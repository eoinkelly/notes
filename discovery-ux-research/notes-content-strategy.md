see also the 'page table basics' google doc

ask “Where is it working?” when we consider content and functionality. Does this
really enhance the user experience? How does this make good business sense? we
need to think of our content like water that can be poured into a multitude of
containers. A content management system is NOT a web publishing system and vice
versa

content as conversation some good stuf fin here - relisten

Accomplish, Know, and Feel. If you understand what your user wants to
accomplish, what they need to know, and how they want to feel, you’re well on
your way discovering what’s necessary for your design to be great.

users "deciding not to decide" is ALWAYS a call to action on your page. adding
more calls to the page or not prioritizing them increases the likelyhood of this

# http://www.alistapart.com/articles/audiences-outcomes-and-determining-user-needs/

only partially digested this so far...

There are 2 questions we need to answer at the discover phase

1.  Who are our audiences? We start with out stereotypes and assumptions and
    hopefully end up with real users. We are not the audience. We can only
    assume what the user thinks. The "audiences and outcomes" process helps us
    make better assumptions. Ingredients for good assumptions about audiences
    input from stakeholders persona development persona confirmation!!!

        Putting the company stakeholders in a room and talking about personas gets buy-in!
        I should be the facilitator, not the dictator in this process.
        Makes it easier to move forward later as we have all agreed on audiences

2.  What do they want from the website?

ith a CMS that’s organized around modular, meaningful chunks of content,

Gammel defines an audience as: Any group of people with some measurable
characteristic in common which influences how relevant and significant they are
to your specific outcomes.

Gammel defines an outcome as: A measurable change, action or behavior that you
wish a visitor to take or experience.

Audiences Who do you feel are your site's audiences? What are the demographics
of these audiences How comfortable with technology is this audience? Who is
currently visiting the site? What makes their visit a success in their eyes? In
yours? Who else is competing for their attention?

    How do you currently communicate with these audiences? How often?
    How does each audience perfer to communicate with you?

Outcomes What do you want to persuade your audience to do? What assumptions do
you make concerning your audiences? Certain socioeconomic group? Familiar wiht
certain aspects of your organisation? What drives your business and how does
your audience help achieve positive results? What metrics do you want to keep
track of?

Company voice/brand person Just stating the goal is not enough. Outcomes must be
_measurable_, otherwise they are not goals, they are aspiriations. If we can't
measure the outcome we can't know 1) how viable it is and 2)what the benefits
are

We are not the audience. We can only assume what our user thinks. Which is where
the audiences and outcomes process comes into play, allowing us to narrow down
who the user REALLY is through stakeholder input, persona development, and
persona confirmation.

# http://www.tcworld.info/tcworld/content-strategies/article/whats-the-buzz-about-content-strategy/

It's that the beauty of the hunt is negated if the treasure is lacking or
missing. Content is the treasure; UX is the treasure hunt.

a big, loosely connected network of practices the main goal of content strategy
is to use words and data to create unambiguous content that supports meaningful,
interactive experiences. Content strategy _plans_ for the creation, publication,
and governance of useful, usable content. which content will be publsihed and
_why_ we are publishing it at all it starts with an audit of existing content At
its best, a content strategy defines: key themes and messages, recommended
topics, content purpose (i.e., how content will bridge the space between
audience needs and business requirements), content gap analysis, metadata
frameworks and related content attributes, search engine optimization (SEO), and
implications of strategic recommendations on content creation, publication, and
governance.

# http://www.alistapart.com/articles/thedisciplineofcontentstrategy/

Instead, let’s assume that there are a number of content-related disciplines
that deserve their own definition, by turn:

1. Editorial strategy defines the guidelines by which all online content is
   governed: values, voice, tone, legal and regulatory concerns, user-generated
   content, and so on. This practice also defines an organization’s online
   editorial calendar, including content life cycles.

2. Web writing is the practice of writing useful, usable content specifically
   intended for online publication. This is a whole lot more than smart
   copywriting. An effective web writer must understand the basics of user
   experience design, be able to translate information architecture
   documentation, write effective metadata, and manage an ever-changing content
   inventory.

3. Metadata strategy identifies the type and structure of metadata, also known
   as “data about data” (or content). Smart, well-structured metadata helps
   publishers to identify, organize, use, and reuse content in ways that are
   meaningful to key audiences.

4. Search engine optimization is the process of editing and organizing the
   content on a page or across a website (including metadata) to increase its
   potential relevance to specific search engine keywords.

5. Content management strategy defines the technologies needed to capture,
   store, deliver, and preserve an organization’s content. Publishing
   infrastructures, content life cycles and workflows are key considerations of
   this strategy.

6. Content channel distribution strategy defines how and where content will be
   made available to users. (Side note: please consider e-mail marketing in the
   context of this practice; it’s a way to distribute content and drive people
   to find information on your website, not a standalone marketing tactic.)

Job areas and what "content strategy" means to them marketing uses a content
strategy to... distribution channels, messages branding, editorial workflows

    enterprise
    	uses a content strategy to...
    		data modeling, technical workflow, documentation, planning for content reuse, and content management, often on a very large scale
    		(not necessiarly focused on user experience -more on efficiency, reducing redundant effort etc.

    media
    	uses a content strategy to...
    		business models, distribution channels,  and the development of content as a product, with secondary focus on marketing and customer service

    User Experience (UX)
    	uses a content strategy to...
    		a bit of all the above but with user centered design at the core of the work
    			Product design becomes feature design; messaging and branding become content goals and style guides; data modeling becomes content templates and page tables.

1. Kristina Halvorson, Brain Traffic: Start asking lots of smart questions about
   your content. This also helps shift the conversation around it.
2. Ken Yau, Baddit: Ask why! Be a pain in the butt. There should be a
   justification for content existing.
3. Fiona Perks, Bright Stuff Communications: A good content strategist never
   forgets about the end user.
4. Julie Mahoney, LBi: Always incorporate different channels – social media,
   mobile devices.
5. Richard Ingram, Ingserv: Use context to shape your content. Don’t just find
   out who your audience are. Discover the circumstances and emotions behind
   their interest.
6. Amy Laskin, Ogilvy: Don’t make assumptions about your users; they will
   surprise you every time.
7. Rob Hinchcliffe, Hour of Play: Find your hook: immerse yourself in your
   community, listen to what they’re saying, find the common themes, and then
   build a narrative around those themes.
8. Nikki Tiedtke, eBay Europe: Before anything, first try to find out who your
   customer is. Not just users but the client. Understand what they need and
   why. Don’t jump into solutions.
9. Jonathan Kahn, Together London: Content strategy is half collaboration,
   advocacy, and organizational change – the deliverables and techniques are
   useless on their own.
10. Steve Wilson-Beales, MSN Entertainment: Find out what your audience is
    searching for, what topics are trending on social networks, use autosuggest
    tools… CS is replying to that need and allows you to create an editorial
    layer.
11. Kath Ludlow, Bright Stuff Communications: Think about content as the stuff
    that people are going to use, enjoy, keep, share, react to and act upon.
    Focus on delivering a strategy that delivers this response on a long-term
    basis. Then you can’t go wrong.
12. Danny McCubbin, Jamie Oliver online: Be transparent in the content you put
    up on site. Don’t intervene too much in the community – your audience will
    tell you if you have got it right or wrong. Be authentic.
13. Chad Butz, Bourne: Get to know the business and marketing objectives inside
    out and relate all you do back to those, from selling in to analytics.
14. Seth Bindernagel. Mozilla: Localisation: ask do you intend your content to
    meet a global audience?
15. Lucie Hyde, eBay Europe: Don’t think multilingual think multicultural –
    language is just the start of localisation.
16. Charlie Peverett, iCrossing: Creating page tables? Make your life a whole
    lot easier – use mail merge http://bit.ly/gQ7LbS
17. Rahel Bailie, Intentional Design: It’s all about the metadata – it governs
    everything.
18. Jeff MacIntyre, Predicate LLC: Every content strategist is, at minimum, a
    professional communicator. This entails two requirements of you. One, never
    sacrifice clarity on the altar of the buzzword, and two, critical thinking
    is mandatory – develop a considered point of view (and rationale) for the
    trends and ideas that matter most to you in your work.

Using your copy, Reflect back to your customers the things that are important to
them

map our offerings to the questions they really want answered what we offer -->
what the customer really wants

Content srategy is not just "what dontent do we need?" - that is an easy
question

content strateg is also: What? what content do we need? this is the easy
question and often the only one asked WHy? why do we need this? How? how is it
going to get done For Whom? what is out custys want to know? why do they come to
our site?

By Whom? who is responsible for creating, auditing, approving it? With what?
When? Where? How often? What next? what happens to the content after launch?
this is a very important question - KH believes that not answering this is why
websites suck.

Core strategy has 2 sides Content components Substance most of this presentation
is about substance this is the meat of the content Structure People coponents

## Messaging

An internal tool used to prioritize content types and choices keep content
consistent (over media & time) guide design choices align content owners

Messaging pyriamid 1 second design, page load time will help form 1 second
impression 10 seconds primary message should be understood by the user in 10
secs the first 10 secs is where we absolutely have to deliver what the user
wants - don't show the user anything else until that has happened who are we why
do we exist how will we satisfy their needs no missions statements on the
homepage - custys don't care what we are commited to, they care what we can do
for them. 2 mins (secondary messages) secondary messages are messages that you
the user should understand withinn 2 mins

All the messages should feed into calls to action

## Primary Message

    Who are you, what do you deliver, what do I get (notice we ask the questions from custy pov)
    Each word has meaning
    All other messages are born from this one
    Laser focused
    Recognizable, memorable

Examples Awesomeco solves the business problems of the worlds mast challenging
websites. Content strategy plans for the creation, delivery, and governance of
content. Better content. Content people care about. Content that supports your
business objectives and meets your users' goals. It's a long-term fix for
content problems of all sizes. This is where we live. This is all we do.

## Secondary Message

Supports the primary message Provides context for the primary message (NB this
is the vital bit) Provide context for Aucience Type of information Task
completion Product/service

## Page level content hierarchy

A page template is a lorem-ipsum wireframe of the page incl. layout

A page table is a specific, wirefram-based content definition It specifies
structures details implicaitons if you commit to doing X case studies, then you
need to commit to refreshing these etc. questions the page table can contain a
wireframe helping authors to visualise it within the page You don't need page
tables for all pages on the site, just key ones do create them for key landing
pages, pages where you really need to nail the messaging. language: we "craft"
=> expensive

Mobile devices require content development teams to focus on only the most
important messages and tasks in any content. There simply isn't room on a 320
x480 pixel screen for extraneous, unnecessary word. You have to prioritize.

Your google search restuls are the start of your conversation with the customer

# Anne Rockley Lecture

Potentially Useful Content

In the South West of England the locals are very much into Potentially Useful
Material, or PUM for short. One man’s PUM is another man’s junk. So, you get a
new bathroom, and instead of throwing out the bath, it becomes PUM because
someday, just maybe, you might need it. If I had a nickel for every time during
a content modelling session I heard a someone say, “lets capture that
information because it might be useful in the future”, I’d be rich man. My stock
response to that is:

Show me the value today and I’ll gladly manage it tomorrow.

Nine times out of ten, these potentially useful content types (PUCs) are
dropped. Be vigilant. Be ruthless. Eliminate waste. Focus on value. Do not
pollute the content model with maybes and PUCs. We are already drowning in
unstructured information, lets not add to it with PUCs.

# Content

Start by figuring out your audience What do your customers want? In what level
of detail do they want it?

Content Inventory vs Content Audit Inventory What have you got? How current is
it? Audit: Is there an existing structure Look for opportunites to re-use How
well will it adapt to new opportunties Analyse how how content is: used re-used
structured

Responsive Content Models must split the content into the structure We want to
know what is it is might use an existing structure (DITA etc.)

Governance is what stops the content going back to being a mess Tools must
**enable** your content strategy Technology is not the focus for content
contributors and never should be.

Content should be: mobile friendly translation friendly

edition ========================================

# Chapter 1: Now

5 things to get started right away on CS

- ## Do less, not more

    "Small websites are easier to manage than big ones. Since this is obvious
    why don't more sites choose to be smaller" Content is more or less worthless
    unless it does one of the following
    1.  Supports a key business objective
    2.  Fulfills your user's needs Use these 2 criteria to evaluate and weed out
        existing content. "Wouldn't it be cool" and "Just in case" are not good
        reasons to keep content.

    Less content is easier to manage. Less content is more user friendly. Too
    much content makes it harder for the customer to make a decision in favour
    of your product and service. Less content costs less to create! Action:
    create a web editorial calendar that says how often content will be
    published. This could be handy for clients who want to blog etc.

- ## Figure out what you have and where it's coming from
    2 types of content audit Quantitive Inventory "What is there" Qualititive
    Assessment "Is it any damn good" They are good ways to get a handle on the
    scope of the problem
- ## Learn how to listen
    Listen to your users - they know lots about being your customer Listen to
    collegues - they each have a perspective on their input to the content
    process
- ## Put someone in charge
    Somebody needs to own "web content" in the organisation. They need the
    ability to say "no" to content. Newspapers & Magazines (publishers) most
    definitely have someone/a team in charge of content The team/person must be
    empowered to make content related decisions especially the "no" one
- ## Start Now
    Ask the boss which part of the website makes them craziest Educate yourself
    about content Ask questions about your own organisations content landscape
    Talk to collegues on a one-to-one basis

# Chapter 2: Problem

What causes content problems

1.  We treat content like a commodotiy
2.  We don't have time to make a plan
3.      We make deadly assumptions
4.  Content is political
5.  It's all too much, we'll never move forward
