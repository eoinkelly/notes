# Scenarios - design tool
=========================
_personas_ in _situations_ whose story is told in _scenarios_

situations are the starting point for our stories

creation is much more effective in a small group, stakeholders (larger group) are really good for review


these tools let us think in sequence
scenarioss
	stories - natural creation tool
		need 4 things for a story:
			characters (personas)
				have:
					human failings
					goals
					not just a job description
					human needs
				ideally data driven but not required
					data lets you be more confident about design decisions
					data lets you back up your soln. to stakeholders
				have a primary persona that we work with and secondary personas that we can think of "how are they different" from the primary persona
			conflict
				what are the situations that our personas will be in that product thas to make delightful
				our requirements come out of this
			plot
				what "should" happen
				the design process
				imagine a better future
			resolution
				where the persona thinks the story ends

	story telling fashion is great way to present design idea to stakeholders
	good "silo" busters for diff skill sets
	scenarios can turn into _use cases_ or _user stories_

	a scenario is a script - the words that describe an action
	a storyboard is a graphic depection of that action as a sequence over time

page description document
=========================
		done after wireframes
	not just a list of elements that go on a page and what is their priority

	questions to ask:
		what's the title of the page
		how can this page be summarised in 1 or 2 sentences
		if the user only scans this page, what is the one message we want them tot ake away
		who is the page aimed at?
		what is th user trying to achieve on this page
		how might the user have arrived on this page
		what is the call to action on this page
		what elements must appear on this page?

# information seeking behaviours
===============================
1. known item
	they
		know what they want
		knows what words to use to describe it
		may have a fairly good understanding of where to start

	the task may not change significantly during the process of finding the answer
	they may be happy with the first answer they find
	in this mode it's important that people can answer the question quickly

	design approaches that can help
		Search
		A-Z indexes
		Quick-links: links to frequently used items to allow easy access to them again
		Navigation: browsing via navigation can suppor this behavior - most effective when the user can clearly idenityf which navigation heading to choose from.

2. exploratory
	they have some idea of what they need to know but might not know how to articulateit or the right words to use
	they may not know where to start to look
	they will usually recognise when they find the right answer but may not know if they have enough information
	information need will almost certainly change as they discover & learn (their gap between current knowledge and target knowledge narrows)
	design approaches that can help
		navigation
		related information
		search

3. don't know what you need to know
	they might think they need one thing but need another
	they might be looking at the site without a specific goal in mind
	this mode occurs when:
		complex domains such as legal, policy or financial
		any time we wish to persuade the users -they might think they want to know about X but we want them to know about Y
		unknown domains - when checking out a new service/product/site on a recommendation from a firend
		keepin gup to today - they want to know what's new in a topic but don't have a particular answer in mind
		design approaches that can help
			straightforward answers
			more detailed information - related or contextual links in the body of the content

4. re-finding
	looking for things they have already seen
	design sol.utions can be active (user takes an explicit action to remember an item) or passive (user takes no action but items are remembered)
		active ex: bookmarking, amazon wishlist
		passive example: amazon remembering last itmes you looked at

Information Architecture Research

good quote
	interviews are cheaper than code to figure out what what your users want and cheaper again than re-doing the site

## Information Architecture is...
	ways or organising and labelling information
	e.g.
		website design
		library sciences
	the categorization of information into a coherent structure, preferably one that most people can understand quickly, if not inherently.

## A practical guide to Information Architecture
### Part 1 - About IA
it's about creating groups that make sense to the people who use them

it's about
	labeling
	organising

	to promote
		findability
		usability
	help people find a way through information and ignore what isn't relevnt
	it's not easy because
		there is always more than one way of organising items
		it's not always clear which way is best
		people have different needs.
		People have different ideas about what goes together
		People have different levels of knowledge about a topic

Ingredients of a good IA
	People
		What do they need to do?
		How do they think?
		What do they already know?

		You need to know about people to group content in ways that make sense to them.

	Content
		What do you have?
		What should you have?
		What do you need?

		You need to know about content to create an IA that works well for current *and* future content.

	Context
		Business & personal goals of the site
		Who else is involved
		What are the constraintso

		The solution needs to work for people & business to be a success (balance user and business goals)
		Good IA works for both users and content - you might have to be the voice for users in the process

IA is an iterative process
	draft -> research -> change based on feedback
AN IA process runs like this:
	Kick-off/discovery meeting stuff

	Research
		User research
		Content research

		Without good research in to people & content you can't make good decision
		It's needed to answer the objectsions and questions that stakeholders will have

	Design (broad sense)
		IA
			Structure
			Groups & sub groups (labelling)
			Metadata
		Navigation
			The navigation must be designed to suit the IA, not the other way round
			Don't start IA as I am developing the front-end

			Includes
				nav bars
				related links
				in-page nav elements (hyperlinks)
				helpers
					a-z indexes
					sitemap

		page layout
		Graphic design & brand
		Prepare Content

	Build
		Build site
		Add content
		Test & release

	Maintain
		Add new content
		Tweak IA, navigation & page layout

User research is not the same as usability testing

User reserach
	Find out about "people" want & need

Usability testing
	Test the IA, navigation  to see how well they *actually* work for people

"Information designer"

Context
	Define
		Goals
			*Why* are they doing the work?
			*What* dow they want to achieve when it's finished
			3 general types
				make more money
				reduce costs
				help people make better decisions
			measuable success criteria let you know when the project is finished! (ideally, rather than budget or time)
			"collecting" goals
				example strategies:
					small: brief conversation with client or senior manager
					bigger: workshop of stakeholders
				example methods of collecting goals
					scenario planning
						ask client to describe ideal outcome in story form
						ask stakeholder/client to desceibe what failure looks like (scenario planning in reverse)
							can be more effective than tackling goals head on
					Pain points
						identify current pain points
							gives you a concrete discussion to start with (goal thinking can be abstract)
					Backcasting
						describe end *positions* in scenario form and work backwards to find out what you need to do to get there
						create scenario of the ideal future, an acceptable outcome and something in between
						can help identify intermediate goals that are more achieveable than one big end-goal
		Technology opportunities & constraints
			What CMS/document management system/intranet is already in place?
		Design constraints
			there may be an existing approach to site navigation
			a standard approach to page layout
			branding requirements
			preferred terminology
			accessibility guidelines
			policy or legal requirements
			whatever they are we want to know them up front.

		Culture
			organisational culture is about the way an organisation works "the way we do things round here"
			it affects how communications are conducted
				will I be able to get access to whoever I need to?
				How are meetings constructed?
					formal, invitations lists etc
				Will I be able to present a rough draft for feedback or only present final deliverables?


		time & budget constraints
			you'll have them

### Part 2 - User Research
learn about the types of info people need
how they use that info when they get it
and how they think about

It helps you select content they need
make the content useful & easy to understand
organise that content in a way that makes sense

	Find out what info they need?
		Look at existing behaviour
			what pages are already popular
			what page could you not live without on the net?
			What would cause a lot of trouble if it went away?

		Understanding needs helps
			access existing information to make sure it meets key needs
			identify information gaps
			make key information easy to find
			prioritise content activities - release or rewrite the most important stuff first
	Find out what they do with that info?
		they don't just find info, they want to do something with it e.g.
			grab a fact
			learn all about it
			compare it to another product
			send it to other people
			save it for later
			copy it into a report
			print it
			read my info before taking aonther step in a process
				check system requirements before downloading sw
				read product description before adding it to their cart
		Where do they use it?
			office + large monitor, plent of time
			mobile, small screen hurry
		What do they already know about the topic?
		How do they describe things?
			helps know what info to group together and how to label it
			how to phrase your content

The process of user research
	Decide what you want to learn and why you want to learn it
		helps decide
			size of project
			whether to run it as formal or informal project
		what questions to ask
			how good is the existing quality of info
			what do they feel is missing?
			play 5 whys game
				1. start with something you know about users
				2. ask "Why do they need/want that?" until your answer is "I don't know" - that's what you need to ask
		how much reserach to do?
			existing web analytics can tell us some things
			existing customer queries
			chat with a few people actually using the site
			questions to help decide how much to do?
				How much do you really know about your audience?
				What are the consequences of getting it wrong?
					a quick fixup (change a label) or a major IA revision?
				How much money is involved if we get it wrong?
					would an IA mistake cost $10, $100, $1000, $10000 etc.?
				How quickly do you get feedback
					Will you hear about it immediately or lose 1000 customers before you find out?
			You can do user reseach more than once
		Who do you research
			Who are you trying to learn about?
				don't just talk to managers
			How do you find them?
				formal recruiting (research companies)
			Informal recruiting
				ask people you already know
		Try to get all team-memnbers whose work will impact a user to be involved in the research
		Are you going to do mostly qualititive or quantitive research (can do both)
			qualatitive (ideas, behaviours, observations)
				best got via interviews, focus groups, observation
			quantitive (statistics, counts etc.)
				best got via surveys, analytics

User research methods
	 use more than one method to avoid analomies in a particular test (practical triangulation)
		http://johnnyholland.org/2009/08/20/practical-triangulation/

	1. focus groups
	2. inteviews
	3. diaries/journals
	4. card sorting
	5. observations
	6. task/activity analysis
	7. survyes
	8. searchlogs
	9. web stats
	10. customer feedback
	11. help desk
	12. call centre

	see the diagram in the book P 75 - she says to choose one method from each quadrant of the diagram
	the quadrants are
		direct vs indirect
			direct: face to face between you and the participant
			indirect: no face-to-face, can collect a lot of information
		self-reported vs observed
			self-reported: rely on the participant telling you what they think they do
				can involve big bias
			observed
				see what people actually do
				advantage is these are authentic - all the behaviour is real

	1. Focus Groups
		small discussion groups with people
		usually conducted outside a normal work environment - meeting room or research facility
		good for getting feelings and opinions about an issue but not so good at getting practical details
		need to be moderated carefully - it's easy for group-think to take over
			can help to get people to do homework and think about issues in advance - they are more likely to defend their position
		good point: you can involve a lot of people in a fixed amount of time.

	2. Inteviews
		one on one discussion
		usually conducted in their normal environment - makes it easier to combine the discussion with examples - they can quickly show you what they are describing
		may also involve watching people going about their normal tasks
		they give rich information nad can be very flexible letting you explore issues and tangents as they come up
		can also be remote or with screen-sharing tech
		can include brainstorming, card sorting and other design games to make them more practical based
		interviews are time consuming to organise, run and analyse

	3. Diaries/Journals
		ask people to record certain information you need
		e.g. you are interested in how they conduct reserach before a big purchashing decision you ask them to make a note every time they collect information
		good for getting big picture insights for a project or collecting detailed information you couldn't get during an interview
		key is to make it easy for participants and knowing exactly what you want to collect

	4. Card Sorting
		good way to get info about how people think about context and categories
		give them index cards with content ideas written on them and them to group the cards in a way that makes sense to them.
			when they finsih ask them to write a short description of each group of cards

	5. Observation
		watch people do their normal tasks
		great if you can talk to them while they do something
		can be combined with an interview
		+ you get to see how things really happen which can be quite different from how people say they will

	6. Task/Activity Analysis
	7. Survyes
		the questions can be
			quantitive: closed questions that can be statistically analysed
			qualititve: topen text-based questions
			a combination of both
		can be used to collect info on how people use something, what they may need in the future and other issues of interset
		+ good for gathering a large no. of responses with little effort
		+ can also compare before/after by using the same questions later
		- the data can lack richness
		- don't give you the chance to probe deeper about an interesting comment even if you ask open-ended responses
		- surveys can tell you what is of interest or problematic buty not always "why"

		Author uses surveys with open questions a lot (the first 3 are most important)
			1. WHy did you visit the website today?
			2. What do you usually visit the website for?k
			3. What information do you use most often?

			4. Were you able to find what you were looking for?
			5. Does the website usually have the information you need?
			6. Is there any information, feature or improvement you would like to see?

	8. Search logs
		from internal search and external analytics
			can give you insight into key information needs and now people describe their needs
	9. Web Stats
		shows you what content people are already using, the most popular areas of the site and the content people aren't using
			temper with with asking whether stuff is popular because it is findable and vice versa
		they only show *what* happened, not *why* it happened
	10. Customer Feedback
		customer emails, letters, forums, call centre logs, help desk queries can also give you good info
		these can over-represent inexperienced people
	11. Help Desk
		these can over-represent inexperienced people
	12. Call Centre
		these can over-represent inexperienced people

	Tips for collecting research
		Have a go - it doesn't have to be academically rigorous to be be useful
		record interviews, focus groups or observations with an audio or video recorder
			later create an edited transcript of the session (removing ums/aahs)
			it's important to capture the interviees' words as they say them - if you try to take notes you'll change the terminology to your own or interpret what people have said as you write it
		for other techniques capture the data as close to raw form as possible
			collect individual survey responses (not aggregated status
			detailed serach terms (not just top 20)
			full email messages (not just subject lines)
		Book recommendation Mike Kuniavsky - Observing the user experience

	If you can't do research...
		still write down what you know about users and the types of things they need to do
			it's not enough just to keep them in your head
			good grid on p 83 that sums it up

	Analysing User Research
		Why analyse
			identify consitent issues
			identify patterns of behaviour
			figure out which issues you are going to tackle
			keep track of insights & ideas

		Analysis process steps
			Prepare - get your data and materials ready
				schedule in some analysis time - it will take time
				it's good to do the analysis as a team - this is especially good if the person designing the IA wasn't involved in user research
				involving people is easier than just telling them what you learned

				5 analysis methods
					Exploring the data
						gives you a feel for high level patterns
						can add tags to help group things in your spreadsheet program - don't worry about creating a consisten ste of tags - can revies later

					2. Term Analysis
						used to learn the terminology and understand how people describe ideas
						choose something you want to know about and use your research notes to
							words used to describe the concept
							synonyms (words with same meaning)
							antonyms (words with opposite meaning)
							related concepts
							broader & narrower terms
							concepts frequently mentioned together
						this can help you understand how people describe their information needs
							it also makes a handy soruce of navigation labels later on

					3. Affinity diagrams
						each person on team goes through the research (transcripts, spreadsheets) and identifies issues they find interesting and writes them on sticky notes
							it might be
								something that surprised you
								something confirmed by research
								insightful quote
								something you heard over and over
						group the sticky notes by similarit4y on a big awall or table
						shuffle them around as you talk about them
							what is important about this gorup of notes?
							why does this happen?
							what is this group of notes about - what is the underlying idea

						the actual group ofnotes isn't important - the real value is in the discussion

					4. 2x2 Matrices
					UP TO PAGE 91

			Deconstruct: pull the data apart so you can look at it outside it's original context
			Manipulate: once it is deconstructed it's easier to manipulate
			Identify: gain insights, start to generate ideas and check that data supporst your ideas
			Summarise & Communicate: write down what you learn and tell others




### Part 3 - Understanding Content
	Content you have
		if there is existing content, you need to understand it before starting your IA or it won't fit
		there are 3 approaches
			1. full content inventory
				lists everything on the site
				it's ideal as you completely understand the content before creating the IA
				it's not always feasible
				a full inventory includes a list of
					all 'pages"
					all downloadable objects such as PDF, documents, speadsheets etc.
					all embedded objects such as video + audio
					other content such as readers comments
			2. Partial content inventory
				For when you can't take a full inventory due to site size or time contstaints
				collects info for a particular number of levels of the site
					may show some parts in more detail
				partial inventory also good if you are creating all content from scratch
					gives a good idea of what content will be there
			3. Content audit
				collects less info than either of the inventory approaches
				is more a "sample" of the site
					details of the first few levels and details of the diff kinds of pages in each section
				useful for product sites where you don't want to list every item sold on the site but you still need a cross section
					as with partial inventory, you may want to create a more detailed inventory of some parts of the site
			What should you collect?
				Only what you'll need for your project
				Example
					Link name: the label used in navigation
					page name: the main heading on a page (may be diff to link name-handy to see if they are diff)
					Page URL
					Content Type: publication, faq, how-to, product, brochure, report, specificaiton sheet, article, something else?
					Resources, PDF or word docs, images, other downloadable things
					Status: current or out of date
					Date updated: when was it updated?
					Owner: Who owns it? (for sites with distributed authors)
					Comments: Anything else you want to note

			Where the 'content' comes from
				Usually the current site
				bur for intranets
					see if people have made workarounds to cope with the shortcomings of the existing intranet e.g. network drives, email folders etc.
					if combining multiple sites, use content from all of them
					are there any customer extranets that might contain content relevant to a broader audience
			Tools for content inventory/audit
				spreadsheets
				can WP generate this semi-auto?
				some CMS might have this facility
				wget and friends
			Showing cross-links in a content inventory can be messy - you might not want to do it

	Content you need
		the content you put on the site should meet user and business needs & project goals
		can be hard to prioritise content for large sites
			3 places to start
				1. current behaviours
					web stats/google analytics helps identify popular content
						dont' just check recent stats - content may get popular at different times of the year
						popular content is only popular because people can find it - If you have good content that isn't popular, think about why that might be
							this could be because:
							wrong place
							poor title
							only imporant to a subset of people
						if it's not imporant to anyone, you are better off deleting it

				2. User Research
					Identify everything in your user research that indicates a content need
						"I go to this site to do..."
						"The page I use most is ..."
						"I use <pages> a lot to do ..."
						"I skim the news headlines every day and read articles that look interesting - tells you they are interested in news but need to dig further to find out what is interesting
						"I need to convince my boss to let me attend the conference" - tells you they need something but not what will help them convince their boss
						also pay attention to needs for functional items like calculators & tools

				3. your/client's ideas for content
					brainstorm with your team and clients

					Competitor analysis
						see what competitors provide and how well they do it
						check that their ideas meet the needs o fyour audience and project goals before including them

	Communicating about content
		there are a few documents that you can use to communicate with authors & your time about content.
			for content authors
				show them what content exists
				discuss what should be deleted or rewritten
				talk about priorities for updating or adding content
				discuss content responsibilities
			for project team
				keep a record of content ideas
				manage project activities such as content updating & migration

			The doucments are
				1. Content Inventory
					useful for talking with authors aobut content
					can combine content inventory with website analaytics data to visually show how people use it
						color code spreadsheet rows according to popularity etc. to help them understand
					can also create summary charts & diagrams

				2. Site map
					useful if the site is small or you want to communicate about the top few levels of a large site
					its basically a way of diagramming the content inventory that's easier to look at than a spreadsheet.
						it doesn't scale well to large amounts of content

				3. INformation needs diagrams
					matches user needs and content together

			*THe authors of the site's content should be involved in the design process from the start*
			content IS the website - don't wait for people to give you content
				ideally the authors should be involved in the user research from the start
			If the content author isn't sure what to write, then they need to be involved in the process more, understand the project goals & user research

	Content Planning & Priorities
		Before drafting an IA you need more than high level content types
			you need details of what the content is and how it will actually be used.
			You need to know what format your content will be in to suit the different tasks & contexts you identified in user research
			Consider whether the site is the most effective way of communicating - esp for intranets, maybe training courses etc. would be better
			Consider content length & volume
				you need to estimate content length and content volume or your IA design will probably fail
				Also you can't arbitrarily decide how much content, categories, levels should be in a design e.g. 200 word pages, no more than 6 links in the nav bar - that's putting the cart before the horse
				figure out what the shortest & longest would be for each piece of content - the design needs to accommodate this
			Audiences
				Is any of the content aimed a particular audience - this needs to be identifed so that it doesn't get lost e.g. if there is content aimed at kids, you'll need to know that when creating your IA so it doesn't get buried in 3 adult pages
			Tasks
				If users have tasks to do, see what content is available for each task - this quickly shows content gaps
					can also identify some high priority tasks that need prominience in the IA
			Accuracy
				How accurate is the current content & what do you need to do about it
					is it out of date? you need to make your IA decisions based on new content, not old.
			Changes over time
				How often will new content be added?
				What kind of content will it be?
				These all have a significant impact on IA
			Is the content Structured or Unstructured?
				structured: every item of a particular type is made up of the same pieces
					you can look at one item and know that all others with the same type are similar e.g.
					e.g. blog posts
					has some advantages
						you can design a standard page for the content type
						when anyone adds new content it automatically gets included in lists that link to it (such as index pages)
						you can create different views of the content and store it once
				unstructured: every item on the site has a different structure
					unstructured content is stuff that only occurs once in a website
					e.g. about us, contact us
					relatively speaking requires more work that structured as you have decide how each piece fits into the structure individually

			Setting content priorities
				You might not release all the content at the same time
				many web projects are released in stages now so that you can release content earlier rather than waiting for the slowest content to be 'finsihed'
				releasing in stages acknowledges that the web isn't a publication - your site will always be changing

				If you are going to releaxe in stages, you need to know what content will be released and when

				4 Example methods
					1. Cyclical or seasonal content e.g. conference
						stages are: launch, call for proposals, registration opens, during conference, after
							there are different content needs at each stage - maybe the IA will change at each stage - multiple IAs on a site - trippy! (the design must accommodate this)

					2. Value vs cost
						group your content into how valuable it is and how much it will cost to produce, the lowest cost, most valualbe should b released first

						Example: a scoring system 1-10
							for each piece of content, score 1-10
								how important is it to users? (=not important,10=critical)
								how much of it was out of date( 1=out of date, 10=accurate)
								how much content was there(1=lots,10=little)
								how quickly the authors could get it updated(1=likely to be slow, 10=fast & responsive)

								They weighted the first criteria higher (by doubling it) and simply added the scores up
						Example: matrix of task
							1. Create a matrix of tasks or steps a given personal would perform with the site
							2. Rank them based on frequency & importance
							this reveals which stuff is most important

					2. Core content first
						rewrite your core content first if lots of other content on the site will link to it

						Future content audit
							get key members of the authors group together
							Talk about who their users are and list them (prioritizing key audiences)
							Brainstorm ideas on content their audiences may be looking for and messages the group wanted to share
							Organise the brainstormed items into a structure, including
								what might need a section, a page or just a few words
								how items are groups and related to each other
								what's feasible to maintain and what's not (record 'wha'ts not items but don't include them int the structure)
								what content belongs to others (and can be linked to)

							then write it up - it gives them a map to follow

	Classification Schemes
		Any set of content can be organised in different ways
		the challenge of IA is to figure out what works best fo ryour audience, your content and your project's goals

		2 common types of classification schemes
			exact scheme
				e.g. alphabetical, geographical
				easy to asing items to individual categories
				categories are easy to create
			ambigious scheme
				you design it from scratch specifically for your situation
				a lot of judgement required in deciding what content goes into what category
				category boundaries are fuzzy
				e.g. subject, audience, task

		Here are 8 classificaiton schemes
			1. Time
				organise content into groups based on when something happens
				useful if time is a key aspect of the content
				e.g. news, weblog, history, tv-guide, event listings
				Questions to ask to see if a time based scheme is appropriate
					will users be keeping up with the content as I publish it?
					How will people accesss the content if they have been away for a few days or want to see what older content is available
						many blogs are bad at this
					Check your user reserach to see if users actually want to access your content in this way
					Time can be used in 2 ways to organise informaiton:
						grouping
							stories could be grouped by day
						sequencing
							stories may be sequenced down a page by time

			2. Alphabetic
				an exact scheme
				they work best when people know what they are looking for AND they know the right words to describe it
				there aren't many situations where you would use alphabetic as the main way of organising your content
					but it can be valuable as a secondary scheme e.g. intranets
				should I list things twice?
					yes you should list things under multiple headings if people will use those words to find them
					but don't balloon the size of your index either - balance key here
				should I use technically correct terms or the terms that people actually use?
					you could try to educate people on correct terminology by including the common term beside the correct one
					if it's important, address it on the page
				you don't necessairly hav eto list every page on the site - could just be the main topic & landing pages - your user resarch will help here

			3. Geography
				an exact scheme
				the real trick to this scheme is knowing whether your users want to access content in this way
				there is a difference between using a map to display information and using a map to navigate to it
					you should know which you are trying to do with this map
					a navigation map doesn't need to be particularly accurate but a map for displaying informaiton really does
				geography may be a good choice as a secondary way to access information, supporting one of the other schemes

			4. File Format
				An exact scheme
				e.g. group videos, articles, tools, tutorials together
				it's a good way of organising your content as long as that is how your audience expects & wants to find it
				most people think about what they want to do and *then* the format they want to see it in - not the other way round
				it can be a good way to show people whats available once they have found the topic

			5. Organisational Structure
				using the structure of the organisation to organise informaiton
				it's easy for authors - they can put their informaiton in 'their' part of the site and managers can see all of 'their' stuff
				the big problem: anyone who needs info needs to know who is responsible for it (and that might change)
				it's ussually a bad idea
					could be ok in small org intranet where everyone knows who does what
						this would need to be supported by user research
					ok in organistaions where structure & rank matter a lot
						e.g. army: it's the way the users think

			6. Task - organise content based on the main tasks that people do
				ambigious classification scheme
					so you have to come up with the categories first and then assign content to them
				can easily end up with too many or varied tasks so it becomes too hard
				it might be more appropriate a lower level e..g. maybe start with audience and then task
				works best for
					a small set of tasks
					the main tasks have clear boundaries
					your content is easy to allocate to the task groups
					e.g. xero.com doesn't use taks based structure but topic
				when looking for tasks in user research look for "I need to..." or "I do..." - whatever follows is usually a task

			7. Audience
				like task based schemes they can be harder than they look
				they are suitable, and only work when
					you can split your audience into groups with clear boundaries
					at any point in time, a user can identify which group they belong to (they may switch groups for different tasks but they need to know where the fit at each instant)
						it *will not work* if the user is unsuer which of your provided audience groups they fit into
					your content assigns cross audience groups without too much overlap
					if you do use audience
						make sure the boundaries are clear e.g. don't use small/medium/large - use specific numbers
						label the groups by the way your users will talk about them
						be really clear with your labelling
							be really clear whether the group is "about something" or "for a group of people" e.g. is "Students, Parents & Teachers" a list of people, or informatioln for these groups?
						you can potentially limit access to informatino by audience or at least make it hard form them to find a full range of information - make sure this is what you intended

				Potential problem: With audience-navigation you’re not sure if the link is FOR the audience or ABOUT the audience.
				@gerrymcgovern believes a website can only handle 3-5 audiences - consider the zipf (long neck, long tail) distribution - there might be 1-2 really important ones

			8. Subject/Topic
				used most often on web projects
				groups similar things together based on what they are about
				it works well for most content

			9. Combination Schemes
				You can use these schemes in combination
				You could
					1. mix up types at each level
					2. start with one type and use a different type at the next level
					3. user more than one approach for your whole content set
						homepage could provide audience, task and topic entry points
				There are no hard & fast rules


### Part 4 - Designing an IA (p 188)
There are 3 inputs to the IA process
	goals
	an understanding of thepeople
	an understanding of the content

IA Patterns
	a pattern is a common solution to a design problem that crops up again and again - the idea came from architecture
	patterns must emerge from real-world use - you don't sit down and create them for a brand new field

	4 Simple patterns
		hierarchy
			can be broad or deep
				broad: lots of items at the top level but few levels
				deep:few items at the top level but many levels
			can be strict or polyheirarchy
				strict: item can be in one and only one place
					required in the real world where items have to be somewhere in physical space
				polyheirarchy: item can be in more than one place
			heirarchies are reall good for
				small websites
				content heavy websites where the content is varied
				when your informations contains different levels of complexity (can present overview first, then drill down to detail
			"everything in 3 clicks" is a myth - better to give people "easy choices" at each level and let them know they are on correct & comfortable path - then they will keep clicking
			e.g.
				whitehouse.gov
		database
			useful where each piece of data has a consistent structure (made up of the same things) but pieces don't have a parent-child realationship (as hierarchy implies)
			e.g.
				etsy
					each piece of content has the same structure and is made up of title, description, tags,image etc.
				blog
					posts don't have a parent/child relationship

			this pattern useful for small & large data sets
			this pattern allows you to store data onece and present it in diff ways e.g. category in WP lets you create a small, opt-in hierarchy -
				it allows you to have multiple ways into the content

				metadata
					there are 3 types
						1. intrinsic: what the object actually is
						2. administrative: how it is used
						3. descriptive: description of the item

						e.g. for a blog
							blog post: intrinsic
							author: administrative
							date posted: administrive
							URL: administive
							Status - published: administrative
							title: descriptive
							category: descriptive
							tags: descriptive
					metadata can be used for 2 things
						generate lists of particular content (all content in category X)
						choose what to show on a page


		hypertext
			is almost a pattern of an anti-structure e.g. wikipedia, wordpress codex, any wiki
			there is no master structure
			content is just joined together with hyperlinks based on their relationship to each other
			each piece of content is independent and connected to pather pieces by associative links
			useful if
				you are creating content over time and not sure exactly what you are going to create e.g. documentation projects
				many sites start with a hyperlink structure and are later organised when content is known
		linear
			not common in websites
			one thing follows another in a straight line
			useful if you have info that you need people to understand before they move on to the next thing - instructional material
			don't use unless people really must read things -it will frustrate them.

		These 4 simple patterns are often combined on sites

			simple hierarchy + database is a popular combo
				use hierarchy for main sections then a database for within each section

			catalog pattern
				very common on ecommerce sites
				it's basically just a database pattern but is a very common one
				Jared Spool written about this pattern a lot
					he describes 3 different types of pages between the homepage and content pages
						gallery pages: provide direct access to the content pages
							he describes these as the hardest working page on a site as this is where users decide to drill down or not
						department pages: provide access to the galleries
						store pages: provide access to the department pages

			hub & spoke pattern
				is really just a hierarchy
				you move down into something more detailed (spoke) just to move back to the original page (hub)
				e.g. linkedin

			subsites
				useful for very large sites & intranets (used to be called portals)
				the overall site is a series of subsites, held together by a homepage or top-level pages
				the subsites can use different patterns
				sometimes a consistent approact to nav & layout in the subsites reinforces that they are part of a larger brand
				useful when after content analysis, you realise there is no one size fits all.
				e.g. usniversites, big business, government

			focused entry points pattern
				useful for large sites where one IA won't fit all needs
				design the site IA with whatever pattern you think will fit best then provide extra "entry points" for certain types of users you don't think the main pattern works well for
				e.g.
					could use a particular category on the homepage for people with interests in a particular topic

			tagged pattern
				uses database or hypertext
				each item on site is tagged with keywords and used to provide access to the content
				works well for large collections of diverse content

			(p 218+219 (as a spread) would be good to print)
	Labels
		are vital to the success of an IA
		people seek information with an idea in their head
			an idea of
				what they are interested in
				what they already call it
				what they hope to see

		ideally the arrive at the site, see the word that's in their head an click on it, learn something and be satisfied
		if they can't figure out your labeling they will feel stupid!

		Labels are all the things that describe chunks of content - names of items in nav, headings, hyperlinks in text etc.
		The best labels are boring and completely obvious - they just work. labels should NOT be interesting & inventive - keep them simple & stable

		good labels do...
			1. call things by their correct name
				sometimes hard to know whether to use "correct" terms or terms your audience understands - sometimes these are in conflict
				don't just use what your audience knows - site can lose credibility and make it harder for people who really do know the content well
				use the most correct terminology you can use, in the context of what your audience knows
					if there is a big gap between correct terminology and audience knowledge - you might need to explicitly deal with this on screen
			2. are consistent
				you need to be absolutely consisten within your own set of content
					people asssume that things that look the same are the same and vice versa - don't mix 'contact us' with 'Get in touch'
					if 2 hyperlinks go to the same content, label them the same way
					for neatness you can make the labelset consistent (use same parts of speech e.g. verbs) but it's not essential
						never create a bad label just to make a set consistent
			3. use terms that your audience uses
				research can help here
			4. are as clear as possible
				use as long a term as you need to describe the content or idea
					don't use a shorter label if it makes the content less clear
					design navigation that lets you use longer labels - don't use short labels to fit in with the navigation
					make labels explain the content they represent - people should be able to guess what might be in a section by the label
					don't use cute obscure labels - you risk people not clicking on them
						OTOH clear labels don't have to be formal

			you can get ideas for labels from:
				Content
					look at the words in the content and the labels they suggest
				User Research
					it will contain lots of word that describe how your audience phrase ideas & concepts.
					Also look at search logs - you'll see exactly what people are looking for and what they call it

				Card Sorting
					the last step involves people assigning labels to the groups they have created
					can give you some ideas

				WHat everybody else does
					Look at competitors or other content like yours - see what they do
						if there is a consistent approach, do your users a favour and follow it.
					Google trends can be useful to see popularity of particular terms
						http://www.google.com/insights/search
		Expect labels to change over time
			as we add more content or move things around, we might need to chagne the labels too
				the site design needs to accommodate this! the nav can't break if label length changes
			keeping an eye on search terms can tell you whether the language people are using is changing


	2. How to create an IA
		Just do it ;-)
		It's an iterative process - just get a first draft down.

	3. Check it
		Your first draft will not work perfectly
			if using hierarchy
				look at draft groups
					will the audience make sense of them
					will they understand the labels
					will they allow the audience to define the tasks they want to do
					does all the content fit in easily?
					is there content that doesn't fit in anywhere?
			if using database
				will the attributes of each type of content give the audience good ways to filter, sort or otherwise narrow down the content
				will the audience understand what each attribute actually means?
				get some sample content and assign the attributes to it, does it fit well? do some attributes need more work?

	4. Revise it.
		loop back to step 2 and revise, go deeper and play with more detail each time.

	5. Stop
		Stop when it feels simple and right and obvious

	6. Discuss
		talk to the client, subject matter experts, colleagues once you have an idea that's not half-baked
		discuss edge cases, user needs - if they start asking about edge cases, then the core is probably good - otherwise they would be picking holes in the idea.

		how many content groups should you have?
			When people are searching for what they need they go through 3 steps
			1. looking through the list of groups
			2. ignoring things that aren't relevant
			3. choosing between things that might be relevant

			fewer groups can make step 1 faster but steps 2 & 3 harder
			more groups makes step 1 harder but 2 & 3 faster
				so it's a balance
				if you're not sure, create 2 versions and test both with audiences and see which reacts better to

				"I don’t want to sound like a smartass (or whatever the
				Australian equivalent is), but the perfect number for items
				in a navbar is ZERO and each item added after that is a
				compromise.
					Zero items requires zero interpretation by the user and
				every item after that requires increasingly more complex
				interpretation. I know zero items isn’t practical (or politically
				realistic), but I think it’s worth thinking of the challenge as
				“what do I absolutely need to add to this list?” rather than
				“how can I whittle down this list?”
				Having said that, I agree with you that long lists
				can work just fine (and that users proving it in testing is
				a powerful way to sell it internally). The key to long lists
				is the speed with which a user can ignore everything else
				other than what they’re looking for. If we can make it more
				about ignoring than interpreting, we have a better chance
				for success. For example, if you put an alphabetical list of a
				hundred names in front of me and my goal is to find my own
				name, it is an exercise in ignoring the 99 items that aren’t
				my name.”
					Dan Willis, uxcrank.com
		Navigation design
			As you draft your IA you will hav eideas for navigation too
				you should finish the IA first but do sketch your navigation ideas
			IA is not the same as navigation

			It's a good idea to draft multiple approaches to navigation and test them to see which works best
				scheme A might work better for audience 1 and scheme B for audience 2 - you might be able to use this
		If stakeholders don't like your IA or have fixed ideas about how you should have done it, you can
			try to re-work it
			or
			work their idea right through the same process as above - see if it works, if not take notes and explain it to them.

		Initial IA draft is best done solo or with small team
		make notes of your rationale s you go - you will almost certainly forget
		she recommends doing it on pen-paper or away from computer - need an environment with maximum creativity
		also consider if the IA will need to change over time e.g. a conference website might be diff after the event

	Testing IA
		good idea to do some usability testing of your groups & labeling
		you'll want to do more thorough usability testing of your final nav, contnet & page layouts

		what you want to learn
			that your groups are sensible and your labels are good
			that your overall approach is good e.g. if you've used audience based clasification scheme, that people expect to see content presented that way and that they understand the groups

		things you need for the test
			1. a draft IA
				it's ok to have things in more than one place if you're not sure
			2. scenarios
				they represent what people will do and look for during the test
				try not to use the same terms you have in your IA or it becomes a treasure hunt- keep the scenarios realistic
					e.g. rather than say 'you need a new bookcase' say 'you have just moved house and have books in boxes everythere - this gets them thinking about what they would do about that problem
					e.g. "find the maternity leave policy" vs "you have just found out you are about to have a baby, what are you entitled to?"
					e.g. "raise a receiveable invoice" vs " you just delivered a report to your client and it's time to ask them for money"
				have enough secnarios that you can cover a good proportion of your IA and a good proportion of the tasks people will do.
				you subjects will learn your IA as they do more tests so randomise the test order and have enough subjects
			3. Participants
				should be the people who'll be using the information
				more info on recruiting participants in chap 6
		test methods (in person or online)
			face-to-face
				can get very useful feedback by asking more why? questions

		index card test (intro spiel p246)
			write out one sentence scnarious on cards and shuffle them
			put top level IA on a card, number each option 1-5
				put 2nd level IA options on other cards, number 1.1 -> 1.5 for ones that come from option 1 in top level
			give the user the scenario, note what they do e.g. A: 1, 1.2, 1.2.1 (no), 1.2, 1.2.6 (happy)
			a helper can also write down the comments the users make during the test

		can use windows explorer folders and files to test too - get them to find a "content" file
		or could create a dummy site nav - maybe convert tabs to indented lists?
			record the time of each click with JS
	Communicating IA
		she suggests communicting IA only after designing nav & page layouts - seeing nav, IA and page layouts together helps people understand how it is all going to work
		IAs are usually documented as sitemaps of some kind

		She uses 2 kinds of sitemaps
			1. Conceptual
				shows top level headings, key pages or sections and key relationsips between pages or sections
				it does *not* show all pages that will be on the site
				if the site is a straightforward hierarchy or database this isn't that useful
				you need to present these diagrams - they are hard to interpret on their own
			2. Detailed sitemap
				can be done as diagram or list
				consider how hard/easy it will be to update in the future
					diagrams can be easy to see at a glance but inefficient to change
				can do sitemaps in spreadsheets or diagrams
				she recomm not showing cross links on diagrams - you can show them in the "copy book"
				sitemaps are rarely kept once the site is finsihed - the site becomes the documentation of the IA

		You also need to document the rationale behind the IA and how to maintain it
			why you chose a certain approach
			what each seciton is about - the underlying idea
			what each section should include
		Also document what you decided not to do, describe the ideas you threw away and why. also document the results of any testing you did
		DOcument how to maintain the IA - this will help you check that it is scalable

		If you don't document your IA in a way that the organisation can use n the future your work will be undone
			be sensitive to the real internal processess of the company
			give docuentation appropriate to the people who will actually have to use it.

### Part 5 - Designing Navigation
	navigation
		is more than a way of letting people move around a site, it can
			let them browse to the content or functionality they need
			show the context of the info
			show what is related and relevnat
			help them find information they didn't know about

		navigation bars
			horizantal nav
				you have a small num of top-level items that fit across the screen
				you aren't likely to add more elements to the menu over time
				your labels are short enough to fit into the horizontal space
				you aren't likely to translate the siteinto a language that uses long compound words
				you want to maximise the amount of page width available for content
			vertical nav bar is more suitable
				you have more top level groups that would fit easily across a screen
				you may add/change groups over time
				some groups have long labels
				you want to translate the website
				RHS nav bars are just as easy to use as LHS according to this lady

			inverted L shape
				combined horizontal and vertical nav bars
					usually a horizontal bar that is consistent across whole site and a vertical one that changes per section

			drop down menu
				it helps describe the category by showing the users all the options in that category

			flyout navigation
				it's drop-down for vertical nav bars
				disadvantage is audience has to move mouse across & down - they might struggle (depending on motor skills of audience)
				possible down sides:
					long menus may go off screen making them impossible to get at
					if they appear too slowly/quickly they might be frustrating to use
					they will probably require JS, make sure you can still nav without it

			giant drop-downs
				where you reveal a large area that gives lots of info on what to click next
				they can show a few levels of your IA if they are laid out well.

		Page body nav
			a lot of your navigation will happen in the page body - very common in database sites. page body nav is a lot easier to use than long lists on nav bars

		Contextual Links
			used everywhere, vital in hypertext (wiki) type IAs
			they must be clearly visible and easy to differentiate from normal text
			label contextual links with the same care as you label menus etc.
				they should be obvious to readers and describe the destination

		Related links
			they allow access to content that's related to the current page
			they allow you to highlight content you'd like to expose to people and help users find things they might be looking for
				? how to implement related links in WP?
				would be a custom metadata of a page that points to other pages on/off site

	Navigation Extras

		Breadcrumbs
			used mainly on heirarchial websites
			useful if user lands in middle of site due to search
			breadcrumbs (despite the metaphor) should show you where you arenot whereyou have been
			many users don't understand them so don't rely on them as your main navigation
			better to use the &rdquo char in breadcrumbs so screen readers don't say "greater than greater than"

		Tag clouds
			often misunderstood by users especially what the different sizes mean
				do usability testing on these if you do use them

		Site maps
			making a resurgance
				good if people want to see everything at a glance and avoid going step by step through the site
					common behaviour if people know what is vailable but aren't sure what section it is in.
				need a way of keeping them up to date easily

		Big footers
			small sites can list everything
			large sites can list the main areas of a site
			they are SEO friendly too

		A-Z index
			lists key content in alphabetical order
			needs really good coverage of the content

		Link-rich homepages
			for some large sites the homepage main goal is to get people to the content they are interested in
			some homepges are designed to reinforce a brand, send people in a particular direction

		Filters
			allow people to narrow down a large set of content
			good when people may approach the content from different starting points

		Faceted Browsing
			a type of filter wher eyou browse step by step narrowing down the result set with each step
			e.g. epicurious ipad site narrows down recipe based on ingredients

	Designing navigation
		Start with the content page, not the homepage
			it's where people will spend most of their time
			it's where they will have success or failure
			most likely it's where they'll be when they want to move to a new page
			if they came from a search engine they might never see the homepage

			when "designing" a content page
				1. go back to user research and content analysis and figure out
					what needs to be on this page
					where people will want to go next - will they want more detailed information or other information about the same topic
					if they need to move between different sections of the site or are emore likely to explore everything in the current section
					where you would like them to go next
					whether it matters if they don't go anywhere and just jump in and leave
				one way to start is to start with the most important goal or information need, the product that generates the most revenue or function that's most frequently use or requested by people - get that working and then see if it needs to be varied for different content or goals

				2. start sketching what needs to be on each page
					sketch the navigtion approaches that will help people do what they need to do
						don't tyr to get it 'right' - try lots of different ideas and approaches

				3. now start working on pages that link to content pages
					might be pages above the content pages in the hierarchy, design gallery pages or comparison pages
					draw different approaches to these pages and how users might experience them.


				4. Think about any navigation extras you want to add in.
					these are important to get right too - if they are wrong users will not click through them

				5. Finally do the homepage
					don't do it first or you site might only work in the homepage -> content direction - the users will spend more time going from content page to content page than from homepage to content page
					homepages generally need to
						communicate who the organisation is
						highlight particular content or features
						allow people to navigate where they want to be.

				6. Revise
					take your initial sketches and revise them
					if you are wondering which approach to take to site nave (top, site, horizontal, vertical nav) try them all
	Testing Navigation
		Test your navigation with as much real content as possible.
			We do this because although we design navigation bars, most navigation happens in the body text via contextual links - to properly test navigation you need to test these links and the page content around them.
			Previously we tested the draft IA in isolation from navigation and content
			Now we test navigation in a similar manner
				this is a much bigger test
			Use steve krug's books to guide your usability testing

		Things to usability test
			Does the IA still work now that it has been made into navigation
			Can people see the main nav bars and know how to use them.
			Do people notice and user other navigational elements such as related links?
			When do people use navigational elements other than contextual links
			Where it's relevant, can people use within page navigation elements such as comparison features
			If you've used something less common, such as faceted browse, how well do people understand what to do with it
			What content works well (and what doesn't work so well)?

			You might want to focus on areas you found hard to design or where there were a lot of comments and changes as you worked through navigation design

		WHen to test
			best time is when you have the content prepared.
				doesn't have to be all of it but the more the better
				you can test without graphic design but you'll have to test again with it.
			don't delay your testing waiting for graphic design or content - it's better to get some feedback rather than wait
			best to test with a working prototype

		Preparing for testing
			similar to IA testing you need
				1. a draft site
				2. scnearios
				3. participants

			some tips
				dont' start all testing form the homepage - mimic search behaviour by starting within the site
				ask particpants to think o things they'd want or expect to find on the site and try to locate them - you can learn good stuff about user's expectations for site content & relationships
				as they work, occasionally ask them what they would expect to find behind certain links - this can give you clues about the terminology they use.
				if people consistently use search during the usability test, think about rewording your scenarios - they might be just trying to put in a scenario keyword instead of thinking about what they want to find
				if people don't click on something you expected them to, wait until the test has finished andask them if they noticed it and what they thought it was - this can be useful learning
				if half your participants look in one place and half in another, ask them what they thought would be in that seciton they didn't look in - you may learn something important about the group or labelling.

	Communicating navigation
		often communicated with wireframes (design drawsings without any visual treatment) - simple lines with few colours

		Creating wireframes
			How much detail to include
				depends on the purpose and reader of the wireframe
					wireframes for management should contain a lot less detail than those for developers
				wireframes are consumed by many types of people on the project
					project team
						to discuss diff ideas & approaches
					subject matter/content authors
						how will their content fit into the site and be represented in it?
						what parts of the page do they have available?
					managers
						have you met business needs?
						"where's my stuff on the homepage?"
					developers
						exactly how should this work?
						how will I implement it?

			Types of wireframe
				Reference zones - shows broad content zones only
					discussing big ideas without worrying about detail
					showing high-level approach across a whole site - highlight consistent and different placement of elements
					exploring different layouts with a team
					discussing high-level flows without gettinginto detail

				Detailed wirefram
					includes final wording of all nav items and content
					probably only use for special pages where detail needs to be specified
					should probbaly show a reference zone version of it first to stakeholders - it's easy for them to become distracted by irrelevant details like content wording

				Combination wirefram
					a mix of reference zone and detailed
					can help people focus - the less importan parts are not shown in any detail

				Specification wireframe
