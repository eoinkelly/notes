# KDF Key derivation function

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function

* key derivation function (KDF) is a cryptographic algorithm that derives one or more secret keys from a secret value such as a main key, a password, or a passphrase using a pseudorandom function (which typically uses a cryptographic hash function or block cipher).
* KDFs can be used to stretch keys into longer keys or to obtain keys of a required format, such as converting a group element that is the result of a Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange into a symmetric key for use with AES.
* Keyed cryptographic hash functions are popular examples of pseudorandom functions used for key derivation
* an original usage was to derive a secret key from a password
