      is superior to the cmd line version

Basics

- An XML dialect for describing 2D artwork
- the artwork can be manipulated by CSS and JS (SVG has a "DOM")
    - only if SVG is inline in HTML or loaded via `<object`>
    - `<img src="foo.svg" />` cannot be manipulated by CSS or JS
- artwork is vector art
- shapes etc. are laid out on a 2D coordinate system (x,y)
- reasons to use it
    - artwork scales well to different resolutions
    - artwork may be smaller than equivalent bitmap image (depends on artwork)
    - artwork can be modified on page by CSS and JS
        - CSS animations
        - JS animations
- current version of spec is SVG 1.1 (2011) - https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/
- browser support: everything except IE8 and older, Android 4.3 and older
- if you convert bitmap to SVG it will just base64 encode the bytes - waste of
  your time and bandwidth
- units of measure
    - in SVG code, units default to `px` if you don't specify them
    - you can use all the usual units of measure: px, em, pt, in, cm, mm, pc, ex
- > the SVG that Adobe Illustrator gives you isn't particularly optimized. It
  > has a DOCTYPE and generator notes and all that junk

## Code

- elements - short reference at http://svgtutorial.com/important-svg-elements/
    - `<svg></svg>`
        - container element
    - `<g></g>`
        - create groups
        - you can apply transforms, fills etc to the whole group
    - `<path />`
    - `<rect />`
    - `<circle />`
    - `<line />`
    - `<polygon />`
    - `<text />`
    - `<textPath />`
    - `<stop />`
    - `<linearGradient></linearGradient>`
    - ``
    - ``
- attributes
    - `viewBox="x y width height"`
        - applied only to `<svg>` element
        - allows you to zoom and crop the element
        - allows you to adjust the viewport of your SVG

## Guidelines for creating SVG in AI

- fill the artboard - ensures SVG will fill the space given to it by the web dev
  on the page
- convert to outlines (removes dependency on external assets like fonts)
- Use special "Save as SVG" export option
