# Facebook API

Facebook dev tools: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/

Uses a _variant_ of Oauth 2.0

Permissions

You ask for permissions during the _login_ process OR you can ask for them
later. The only permissions you can ask for without review are

1. public_profile
2. email
3. user_friends

- All other permissions require Facebook to review and approve the app before
  the request for those permissions will become visible in the login dialog.
- Developers are excempt from this rule
    - Consequences: Test app on more than just developer accounts!!!
- To test what permissions your app has for a given user issue
  `GET /{user-id}/permissions`
- Users may deny the permissions you ask for so we have to check that we
  actually got what we asked for.

an app can revoke permissions that a user has given it:

    DELETE /{user-id}/permissions/{permission-name}

or it can revoke access entirely:

    DELETE /{user-id}/permissions

Both the above Graphs API requests must be made with a valid _user access token_
or a valid _app access token_.

## Anatomy of an access token

There are 2 types of access token

- User = used by humans
- App = used by apps

An access token

- is a _variable length_ char string that FB associates with
    - App ID
    - User ID
    - Issued
    - Expires
    - Valid
    - Origin
    - Scopes
        - the permissions this user has _granted_ to this app (the app may have
          _asked_ for more)
        - e.g. public_profile, email
- it usually has a lifetime of a few hours but you can get a "long lived token"
  if you are accessing facebook.com from a server.

## App settings

### Basic Settings Tab

- App ID
    - Unique ID code for the appp
    - Used to initialize the SDKs
- App Secret
    - secret "password" that the app has embedded in its code so that
      facebook.com can identify requests from it
    - If using a native facebook SDK these are stored in the plist/properties
      file in the project
- Display Name
    - Pretty name for use in UI presented to the user
- Namespace
    - the namespace uniquely identifies _objects_ and _actions_ of your app on
      Facebook.
    - The namespace you choose will be used to identify objects specific to your
      application (e.g. yourappns:meal) and actions published to a Timeline
      (e.g. yourappns:eat).
    - is also the short app name used for your Canvas Page URL (e.g.,
      apps.facebook.com/YOUR_APP_NAMESPACE)
- App Domains
    - can associate a DNS domain with the app.
    - possibly only needed for apps hosted elsewhere but displayed on
      facebook.com ???
    - `TODO: for what reason ???`
- Contact email
    - The email address that is linked to by facebook.com as support for the
      app.
    - used by facebook for all app related communications

### Advanced Tab

- Native or Desktop app boolean
- Deauthorize Callback URL
    - A URL that facebook will "ping" when a user deauthorizes the app
- Age restrictions
    - Contains Alcohol
    - Age Restriction
    - Social Discovery ???
    - Country restricted ???
- Security
    - Servier IP Whitelist
        - a ? separated list of IP addresses that app requests using the app
          secret must come from
    - Update settings IP whitelist
        - a whitelist of IP addresses that can lock down where "app settings"
          are updated from ??? are app settings only editable from
          developers.facebook.com
    - Update notification email
        - Who to email when app settings change
    - Auth settings
        - Client token
        - enable client oauth login
        - boolean: app secret proof for server API calls
        - Embedded browser Oauth login
        - Require 2-factor reauthorization for changing "application settings"
        - Valid Oauth redirect URIs ????
- App-scoped User ID sharing
- Advertising Acocunts
- Insights
    - install insights
    - Enable enhanced interest targetting
- Migrations
    - A set of boolean flags that controls which of the currently in progress
      API migrations are turned on for your app.
    - Varies depending on what migrations Facebook is currently doing

## Platforms

An app can have many _platforms_. In 2014 platforms are one of

1. Website
2. Android App
3. iOS App
4. Facebook Canvas
5. Windows App
6. Playstation
7. XBOX
8. Playstation

### Website section

The config here only applies to the JS SDK

- Site URL
    - Guess: used by facebook for knowing where to redirect the browser to after
      auth
- Mobile Site URL (optional)
    - Assumption: If you have a separate mobile domain, then facebook can send
      people back to it instead if they came from the mobile login flow.

### iOS Section

- Bundle ID
- iPhone Store ID
- iPad Store ID
- URL Scheme suffix (optional
- Single sign on boolean
- Deep linking boolean

### Android section

- Package Name
- Class Name
- Key Hashes
- Single sign on boolean
- Deep linking boolean

# Test users

- are invisible to real accounts
- used for automated testing of an app
- 2 ways to create:
    1. via graph API
    2. manually via dashboard
- test users can only interact with other test users
- they cannot become a fan of a page
- can only be accessed by developers of the associated app
- each app can have max 2000
- cannot be converted to normal accounts
- Will automatically have the "tester" role (and associated privileges)

# Test apps

- all test apps share the same app-scoped user ID namespace as the production
  app
    - makes it simpler to debug issues with app scoped Ids
- are always in development mode
- have same _platform migration_ options as the production app they were copied
  from
    - allows you to test migrations
- Have the same version availability as a prodction app
- test apps are _children_ of a production app

# App review

- forces mobile apps to use the native SDK
- review time is approx 3-7 business days
- we need to provide test users for the reviews to use

# API versioning

- Not all APIs and SDKs share the same version e.g. graph API is versioned at a
  different pace and numbering compared to the iOS SDK.
- All SDKs can interact with multiple versions of APIs
    - Core - will stay stable for 2 years
        - e.g. SDKs, Login dialog, Share dialog, Requests dialog, _some_ Graph
          API endpoints
    - Extended
        - e.g. Ads Pages
        - are subject to _Migrations_
        - a migration is the period of time where both the old and new behaviour
          is available
        - you can turn them on/off via the graph API or via the App dashboard
          (during the 90 day period)
        - may migrate every 90 days

- If you don't specify an API version in your call (aka an "unversioned" call)
  you will get the oldest available version of the API
    - implications: always specify a version
    - SDKs automatically use whatever version is most recent when they were
      downloaded

## The SDKs

- Javascript:
    - `FB.init` you pass the version you want as a parameter
- iOS:
    - the version of the API you use is hard-coded to be the most recent
      available when that version of the SDK was released
    - you can override with `[FBRequest overrideVersionPartWith]`
- Android
    - the version of the API you use is hard-coded to be the most recent
      available when that version of the SDK was released
    - can override with `Request.serVersion()`

In all the SDKs the version is prepended to the API calls e.g. `me/events`
becomes `/2.0/me/events`
