# Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track

* Engineering mangement books
    * The Managers path - Camille Fournier
    * The making of a Manager - Julie Zhuo
    * Resilient management - Lara Hogan
    * An Elegant Puzzle - Will Larson

* _staff+_ is their catch-all term for all levels above senior
* Senior -> Staff -> Principal -> Distinguished

The "staff engineer" role can vary a lot between orgs. Here are some common pattens:

1. Tech lead
    * Guides the _approach_ and _execution_ of a single team or a cluster of teams
    * Partner closely with a single manager or with 2-3 managers ina single focused area
    * comfortable
        * _scoping_ complex tasks
        * _coordinating_ their team towards solving them
        * _unblocking_ the team along the way
        * _maintaining relationships_ with other teams
    * close partner to the team's product manager
    * code less than they used to but they still code
    * often the first role a staff+ engineer will play
    * the day to day work is somewhat similar to a senior engineer so is a somewhat intuitive transition
    * quote
        > an org needs roughly 1 tech lead for every 8 engineers
    * some companies use "tech lead" as a title, some use it as a role
1. Architect
    * responsible for the direction, quality and appraoch within a critical area
    * combines in-depth knowledge of technical constraints, user needs, org level leadership
    * responseible for the success of a specific technical domain at the org e.g. API design, front-end, storage strategy, cloud strategy etc.
    * for a domain to need an architect, it needs to be complex and **enduringly central** to the company's success
    * some companies want architects to write no code, some want them to stay deep in the code
    * the role tends to emerge in companies with complex codebases or domains
1. Solver
    * digs into arbitrarily complex problems
    * trusted agent who goes deep into knotty problems, continuing to work on them until the are solved
    * have relatively little "org level chiropractics" to perform vs the other roles
    * sometimes focuses on a given area for a long time, others bounce from hotspot to hotspot guided by org leadership
    * ++ you are always working on essential problems
        * ++ likely to get recognition from leadership
    * -- you are jumping from one fire to the next
        * -- not much stable overlap with others who do your role, limited community?
1. Right hand
    * least common archetype role
    * extends an executives attention
    * borrows their scope and authority to operate particularly complex orgs
        * this requires you to remain very aligned to that leader's vision
    * they provide additional leadership bandwidth to leaders of large orgs
    * ++ you are always working on essential problems
        * ++ likely to get recognition from leadership
    * -- you are jumping from one fire to the next
        * -- not much stable overlap with others who do your role, limited community?

There may be other patterns and a role might include a mix

Being a staff engineer is not just a role - it is the intersection of the role, your behaviours, your impact and the orgs recognition of those things
