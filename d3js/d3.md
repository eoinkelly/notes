- selection

- a set of DOM nodes

D3 provides a "jquery esqe" way of manipulating the DOM

You can turn DOM attributes into computed properties

Join types

join-by-index

```js
d3.select('body'); // create selection containing single node
d3.selectAll('p'); // create selection containing many nodes

// Get all <p> elements and bind each one in turn to an elment from `someArray`
// This only has to be done once

d3.selectAll('p').data(someArray);
```

enter() and exit() create selections too

D3 is all about mapping a dataset to a set of DOM nodes and then

- automatically updating the nodes when the data changes
- create new nodes if data is appended
- delete nodes if data is deleted

Most selection methods return the same selection `append()` returns a new
selection that only includes the new elements!

_data domain_ = the min and max value of the data

A D3 scale maps from the _data domain_ to a _display range_
