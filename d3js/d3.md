* a set of DOM nodes

D3 provides a "jquery esqe" way of manipulating the DOM

You can turn DOM attributes into computed properties

Join types

join-by-index

```js
d3.select('body') // create selection containing single node
d3.selectAll('p') // create selection containing many nodes


// Get all <p> elements and bind each one in turn to an elment from `someArray`
// This only has to be done once

d3.selectAll('p').data(someArray);
```

enter() and exit() create selections too

D3 is all about mapping a dataset to a set of DOM nodes and then

* automatically updating the nodes when the data changes
* create new nodes if data is appended
* delete nodes if data is deleted


Most selection methods return the same selection
`append()` returns a new selection that only includes the new elements!

_data domain_ = the min and max value of the data

A D3 scale maps from the _data domain_ to a _display range_
