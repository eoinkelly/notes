# Union file system

> Union file systems allow files and directories of separate file systems, known
> as branches, to be transparently overlaid, forming a single coherent file
> system.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnionFS

- used by linux live cds
- branches can be read-only or read-write
- a write actually copies from a read-only layer onto a higher priority writable
  layer which is then mutated
- docker uses unionfs

## unionfs

- available for linux, freebsd, netbsd
- implements a "union mount" for _other filesystems_
- each layer of the filesystem is called a "branch"

Alternatives

- aufs
- overlayfs
    - used in openwrt
    - is in mainline linux kernel since 2014

- plan 9 uses union mounts a lot
- gnu hurd has a unionfs implementation

TODO: I have seen zfs and device-mapper mentioned in the same breath as
overlayfs and aufs - investigate why?

## aufs

- aufs (short for advanced multi layered unification filesystem) implements a
  union mount for Linux file systems.
- aufs has not been merged into linux mainline kernels - code was too dense and
  unreadable
    - overlayfs was merged in instead
- a rewrite of unionfs
- many livecds have chosen aufs instead of unionfs
- docker uses aufs ???

# Docker storage backends

https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/selectadriver/

- docker daemon can only used on storage driver at a time ( => all containers
  must use the same one)
- docker supports many storage drivers
    - overlayfs
    - aufs
    - btrfs
    - devicemapper
    - zfs
    - vfs
- use `docker info` to see which storage driver is set
- The `Backing Filesystem` is the filesystem that is being layered/unioned by
  the storage driver \* this is the fs used to create the docker host's "local
  storage area" under `/var/lib/docker` AUFS is only the default storage back
  end on systems/distributions that have it available. Otherwise, devicemapper
  is the default. Ubuntu 14.04, for example, defaults to devicemapper

This changed in Docker 0.7.0. Prior to 0.7.0, Docker relied upon AUFS as its
only storage driver, which is why it was the default in earlier versions of
Ubuntu.

discourse strongly recommend not using devicemapper for docker - they recommend
aufs
