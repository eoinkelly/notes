Kitematic shows the "in container" path on its container homepage

# Background

Docker has two ways to make data last longer than the container

1. data volume
2. data volume container

# Data volumes

- a designated dir within _one or more_ containers that bypasses the unionfs
- ++ fast: changes are made directly without needing to deal with the layers of
  the union fs
- data volume persists even if the container is deleted
- data volume can be shared and re-used between containers
- use `docker inspect` to see details of the volume
- data volumes are NOT the same as mounting a directly from the host machine
    - you can optionally mount a directory from the host machine into the volume
- changes to data volumes are made directly (not through unionfs)
- they persist even if the container is deleted

- There is a complication on Mac and Windows because the "docker host" is
  actually a linux VM. \* docker mounts `/Users` from the mac into `/Users` on
  the docker host so you can share dirs from /Users with containers

- docker does not automatically delete a volume when you remove a container
- it will also not "garbage collect" volumes that are no longer referenced by
  any container

- mounting a host (note: linux is the host, not mac) directory is just a special
  case of creating a volume. Instead of the volume being in something like
  `/var/lib/docker/volumes/fac362...80535/_data` it is an existing dir on your
  linux-host.

Where are volumes stored?

- volumes are stored on the linux-host filesystem (not in the unionfs files that
  the containers use)

How do I see what volumes are on a docker host?

- writing into the container can have perf impacts depending on the storage
  driver being used by the container

The dockerVM on mac "auto shares" a number of mac filesystem dirs with itself

```
/Users
/Volumes
/tmp
/private
```

# Data volume containers

Create a container which has the job of mounting the data volume (from the
linux-host) and making that data available to other containers
