# kernel features

Docker uses certain features of the linux kernel

1. namespaces
    - linux kernel provides separate namespaces for things like
        - pids
        - network interfaces
        - mount points
        - users
        - IPC
2. control groups
    - allows docker to share hardware resources between containers and
      optionally setup limits on those
3. chroot
4. union filesystem
    - there are a no. of options:
        - aufs
        - btrfs
        - vfs
        - DeviceMapper

Docker combines the features above into a wrapper called a "container format"

There are multiple container formats

- libcontainer (docker default)
- BSD jail
- LXC (traditional linux container)
- Solaris zone

## Namespaces

> Linux namespaces, originally developed by IBM, wrap a set of system resources
> and present them to a process to make it look like they are dedicated to that
> process.

## Cgroups

> Linux cgroups, originally developed by Google, govern the isolation and usage
> of system resources, such as CPU and memory, for a group of processes. For
> example, if you have an application that takes up a lot of CPU cycles and
> memory, such as a scientific computing application, you can put the
> application in a cgroup to limit its CPU and memory usage.

> Namespaces deal with resource isolation for a single process, while cgroups
> manage resources for a group of processes.

Docker vs LXC

Docker restricts containers to run as a single process. If your application
environment consists of X concurrent processes, Docker wants you to run X
containers, each with a distinct process. By contrast, LXC containers have a
conventional init process and can run multiple processes

> Portability. This is perhaps the single most important advance of Docker over
> LXC. Docker abstracts away more networking, storage, and OS details from the
> application than LXC does.
