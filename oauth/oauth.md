# OAuth

- allows you to grant 3rd party access to your web resources without sharing
  their passwords
- is an _authorization_ protocol not an _authentication_ protocol!
    - You have to add something like OpenID on top to get authentication
- NOTE: you cannot run OAuth without SSL and expect it to be secure because you
  have to send the "token" and the "secret" to the client somehow
- OAuth is really for delegation not authorization - maybe should have been
  called "ODelegate"
    - delegates authorization to a authorization provider

## Aside: OAuth spec requires application/x-www-form-urlencoded for POST requests

- The OAuth spec does say that POST requests must use the
  "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" mime type.
- That mime-type does not support non-ascii characters so the steps are
    1. encode your text with UTF-8
    1. encode the UTF-8 stream as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` (which
       will add various escape sequences etc.)
- this has implications for parsing this data too (you have to follow those
  steps in reverse)

## Version 1

- OAuth 1 = RFC 5849
- deprecated
- largely based on
    - Flicker API Auth
    - Google AuthSub
- -- requires crpyto capability on client-side
- -- did not scale particularly well
    - -- requires state management across setps
    - -- issues long lasting credentials (less secure, harder to sync across
      data centers)
- -- required endpoints to have access to both the "client credentials" and
  "token credentials" which prevents enterprises from having a centralized
  authorization server to issue credentials and a separate server for API calls
- Methods for obtaining access tokens are called "flows"
- OAuth 1.0 has 3 flows:
    1. web based apps
    2. desktop clients
    3. mobile/limited devices but they get merged into one which in practice
       only worked well for web based apps.

## OAuth 2

RFC 6749 http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749

- OAuth 2 is not backwards compat with 1
- 2 is more of a framework than a protocol
- ++ does not require clients to have cryptography
- ++ 2.0 signatures are much less complicated
- 2.0 access tokens are "short lived"
    - server can issue short lived "access token" and a long-lived "refresh
      token"
    - the client can use the "refresh token" to obtain a new access token
      without involving the user again
- has better support for non browser based applications
    - 1.0 **required** apps to open a browser to complete auth
- the "authorization server" (thing that issues tokens) and the resource server
  handling API calls are two distinct roles
    - in many cases both roles are on the same machine but they don't have to be
      (allows scaling)

Problems that OAuth 2 solves:

1. Delegated access
    - I want to provide access to some restricted resource that I own to one or
      more third-parties without giving them my credentials for that resource.
    - examples:
        - I own a git repo on github.com and I want to give apps (e.g. CI,
          Slack, Gitter etc.) access to it.
1. Federated identity

### Four Roles

The spec defines 4 roles

1. Resource owner (User)
    - A _user_ who grants access to a _client application_ to access their
      account
    - Each "access grant" has a limited scope
        - scope examples: read only, read/write
1. Resource server
    - hosts the protected resources e.g. photos, git repo
1. Authorization server
    - verifies the idenity of the _user_ and issues access tokens to the
      _client_
    - In many/most cases a single server will play both the authorization server
      role and the resource server role.
        - In this case this combined role is called the "Service role" or "API
          role"
1. Client (Application)
    - The _application_ that wants to access the user's account

### An Authorization grant

- is a workflow **and** a kind of credential
- represents the resource owner's authorization to the client application to
  access the protected resource
- is an abstraction over the idea of granting authorization
    - in some cases the grant is an authorization code that allows you to get an
      access token which allows you to get the protected resource
    - in some cases it is an access token that allows you to get the protected
      resource

There are four defined grant types:

1. authorization code grant
2. implicit grant
3. resource owner password credentials grant
4. client credentials grant

### 1. authorization code grant

The flow

1. client-app begins authentication by redirecting user to the authorization
   server passing the following parameters as part of the URL:
    - required parameters
        - response_type=code
        - client_id
    - recommended parameters:
        - state
            - used to prevent CSRF (see section 10.12) TODO
            - client-app can send an opaque "state" parameter with this
              redirect.
            - The authorization server must pass this parameter back to the
              client-app when the user has finished.
    - optional parameters:
        - redirect_uri
        - scope
    - example

    ```
    GET /authorize?response_type=code&client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&state=xyz
            &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient%2Eexample%2Ecom%2Fcb HTTP/1.1
    Host: server.example.com
    ```

1. authorization server checks that the request is valid
1. user authenticates themselves with authorization server
1. user chooses whether to give the client-app the access level it requested to
   their protected resources
1. authorization server creates an "authorization code" that represents this
   granting of access
1. auth server redirects user back to the `redirect_uri` it got from the
   client-app
    - parameters (appended to the redirect URI)
        - code (required)
            - the authorization code
            - recommended that this code
                - only remain valid for 10 mins max
                - can only be used once - if client tries to use it more than
                  once the authorization server should revoke all tokens issued
                  based on that code
        - state (recommended)
            - the state pararameter received from the client-app
        - example
        ```
        HTTP/1.1 302 Found
        Location: https://client.example.com/cb?code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA&state=xyz
        ```
    - any errors in the process are communicated back to the client via an error
      response
    - error response URL paramenters
        - error (required)
            - values are one of
                - `invalid_request`
                - `unauthorized_client`
                - `access_denied`
                - `invalid_scope`
                - `unsupported_response_type`
                - `server_error`
                - `termporarily_unavailable`
        - error_description (optional)
            - human readable description of error
        - error_uri (optional)
            - URI for human to find out more about error
        - state (required if client gave server a state parameter)
    - error example

    ```
    HTTP/1.1 302 Found
    Location: https://client.example.com/cb?error=access_denied&state=xyz
    ```

1. client-app makes a request to the authorization server token endpoint
    - client-app authenticates _itself_ with the authorization server during
      this step
        - usually this will be by sending a "client secret" via the HTTP
          Authorization header
    - parameters
        - grant_type=authorization_code (required)
        - code (required)
            - the authorization code from the previous steps
        - redirect_uri (required)
            - this redirect uri MUST match the one sent by the client as part of
              trying to get the authorization grant in the previous steps
        - client_id (required)
            - part of how the client authenticates itself with the authorization
              server
    - example

    ```
    POST /token HTTP/1.1
    Host: server.example.com
    Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    grant_type=authorization_code&code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient%2Eexample%2Ecom%2Fcb
    ```

1. authorization server validates the request
    - is client authentication ok?
    - does the `redirect_uri` match the one stored in the previous steps
    - is the authorization code valid?
        - has it expired?
        - has it been used before?
1. authorization server replies with an access token (and optional refresh
   token) to the client e.g.

    ```
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
    Cache-Control: no-store
    Pragma: no-cache

    {
    "access_token":"2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA",
    "token_type":"example",
    "expires_in":3600,
    "refresh_token":"tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA",
    "example_parameter":"example_value"
    }
    ```

#### Pros/cons of this grant type

- ++ the access token is sent directly to the client, not through the user's
  "user agent"
- ++ the client-app can be authenticated with a secret token known only to it
  and the auth-server (Facebook does this)
    - the secret token can be agreed when the app is registered, long before the
      authorization request happens
- -- quite a few round trips required to get the protected resource (performance
  penalty)

### 2. implicit grant

Characteristics of this flow

- a simplified flow
- optimized for in-browser (untrusted) client-apps e.g. JS apps
- access token is issued directly - no authorization code step
- does not support refresh tokens because client cannot be trusted to store
  tokens

The flow

1. client registers itself with the authorization server
    - it gets a client id but NOT a client secret (the untrusted client could
      not keep it secure so no secret is used)
    - this may happen a long time before the other steps
1. User asks client app to do something that requires access to the protected
   resource
1. client-app sends user to an authorization server URL
    - this redirection to a URL can be considered a sort of "function call"
    - client-app provides arguments to the "function call" in the form of
      parameters to the URL:
    - parameters
        - required parameters
            - response_type=token
            - client_id
        - recommended parameters
            - state
        - optional parameters
            - redirect_uri
            - scope
    - example
        ```
        GET /authorize?response_type=token&client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&state=xyz
            &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient%2Eexample%2Ecom%2Fcb HTTP/1.1
        Host: server.example.com
        ```
1. The authorization server validates request and checks that the `redirect_uri`
   is actually registered by the given `client_id`
1. user authenticates themselves with authorization server
1. user chooses what kind of access to give the client-app to their protected
   resources
1. auth-server creates an "access token" that allows client-app to access
   protected resource
1. auth-server redirects responds to the request with a HTTP 302 and a
   `Location` header that is the client provided redirect_uri with some
   parameters appended.
    - parameters:
        - required
            - acces_token
            - token_type
            - state
        - recommended
            - expires_in
        - optional
            - scope
    - the authoriztion server MUST NOT issue a refresh token (because client
      cannot be trusted to store it)
    - example:
    ```
    HTTP/1.1 302 Found
    Location: http://example.com/cb#access_token=2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA
            &state=xyz&token_type=example&expires_in=3600
    ```

    - An error is returned if something goes wrong - see section 4.2.2.1 for
      details
    ```
    HTTP/1.1 302 Found
    Location: https://client.example.com/cb#error=access_denied&state=xyz
    ```
1. The client makes a request to the `Location` HTTP header it got from the
   previous step
1. This loads a new HTML document with both the access_token and JS that can
   make use of it
1. client (JS app) uses the access token to access protected resource on a
   server

Pros/cons

- -- no authentication of the client by the authorization server
    - browser cannot be trusted with a client secret
    - in some cases this may be possible by inspecting the redirect URI used to
      get from client-app to auth-server but this URI is exposed to the user and
      their user-agent (browser)
- -- the access token is embedded in the redirection URI so can be visible to
    1. resourse owner
    2. other applications on the same device
- ++ less round-trips require to obtain access
- ++ useful for JS apps that need access to a resource for a short time (few
  hours)

### 3. resource owner password credentials grant type

A simple flow where the user's credentials are entered into the client and used
to obtain an access token.

The flow

1. client-app shows UI to allow user to enter their credentials
    - oauth spec does not specify how this happens
1. client-app sends user credentials **and** its own client credentials (to
   authenticate itself) to auth-server's _token endpoint_ which sends back
   access token (and optional refresh token)
    - params must be sent as `application/x-www-form-encoded` body of the GET
      request
        - the headers are reserved for the client app to authenicate itself
        - Aside: the implementations I have seen allow client to authenticate
          itself with params or header
    - request params:
        - required
            - grant_type=password
            - username
            - password
        - optional
            - scope
1. authorization server sends back a response with the new token(s) e.g.

    ```
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
    Cache-Control: no-store
    Pragma: no-cache

    {
        "access_token":"2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA",
        "token_type":"example",
        "expires_in":3600,
        "refresh_token":"tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA",
        "example_parameter":"example_value"
    }
    ```

1. client (ideally) discards user credentials and uses access token from then on
    - client-app may also get a "refresh token" to allow it to get new access
      tokens
        - the win here is that the refresh token is safer to store in client-app
          than the users creds. The refresh token is only good for getting
          tokens from this auth server but the resource owner's username and
          password could unlock much more on the network.

Use cases for _resource owner password credentials_ grant:

- used to migrate existing clients using HTTP basic auth to OAuth
- useful when the resource owner has sufficient trust in the client to enter
  their credentials directly

Pros/cons of this grant type:

- -- only useful is there is a high level of trust between client-app and
  auth-server
- -- the client-app can see and store the users credentials
- ++ client-app only needs the users credentials to get the access token so it
  doesn't have to store them or put them on the wire for each request. This
  makes it an improvement over HTTP basic auth.

### 4. client credentials grant

The flow

1.  client sends it authentication to the authorization server
    - spec says `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` is required mime type
    - doorkeeper allows client so send authization in the HTTP header or via
      `client_id` and `client_secret` params
    - example:

    ```
    POST /token HTTP/1.1
    Host: server.example.com
    Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    grant_type=client_credentials
    ```

1.  server authenticates the client and if valid replies with access token(s) _
    params (encoded as `application/x-www-form-encoded` in GET request body) _
    grant_type=client_credentials (required) _ scope (optional) _ client must
    send some sort of authentication HTTP headers ``` HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8 Cache-Control: no-store Pragma:
    no-cache

        {
        "access_token":"2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA",
        "token_type":"example",
        "expires_in":3600,
        "example_parameter":"example_value"
        }
        ```

    Notes

- server CANNOT send back a `refresh_token` in its response
- the client MUST authenticate itself

Use cases

- when the authorization scope is limited to things the client-app already has
- used when the client-app is also the resource-owner i.e. it is acting on its
  own behalf
- when the resource owner has done "something" to tell the authorization server
  that it should allow this client to access these protected resources and that
  "something" is out of scope of the OAuth spec

- some form of client-app authentication (e.g. username+password or secret key)
  is used as the authorization grant

### Custom grant types e.g. SAML

- more grant types can be defined via an extensibility mechanism
- a client uses an "extension grant type" by
    1. using an absolute URI (which has been defined by the authorization
       server) as the `grant_type` parameter
    1. sending any extra parameters required

New grant type example: Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)

- `grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:saml2-bearer`

```
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Agrant-type%3Asaml2-bearer
&assertion=PEFzc2VydGlvbiBJc3N1ZUluc3RhbnQ9IjIwMTEtMDUaG5TdGF0ZW1lbnQ-PC9Bc3NlcnRpb24-
```

## Selected topics from the spec in more depth

The spec doesn't have a clear narrative so the following topics are a bit
disjointed

### Rules for authorization server responses

- authorization server replies must be JSON with the `Cache-control: no-store`
  HTTP header

Error responses from the authorization server are JSON and have the form

```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache

{
    "error":"invalid_request"
}
```

The legal keys are

- error (required)
    - values are one of
        - invalid_request
        - unauthorized_client
        - access_denied
        - invalid_scope
        - unsupported_response_type
        - server_error
        - termporarily_unavailable
- error_description (optional)
    - human readable description of error
- error_uri (optional)
    - URI for human to find out more about error

### Refreshing an access token

Client can use its refresh token to get a new access token

- refresh token request
    - parameters must be included in HTTP request body as
      `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` values
    - Parameters
        - grant_type=refresh_token (required)
        - refresh_token (required)
        - scope (optional)
            - must not include any scope not granted in the original token grant
    - the client _may_ authenticate itself again when refreshing the access
      token
    - example

        ```
        POST /token HTTP/1.1
        Host: server.example.com
        Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
        Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

        grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA
        ```

- Refresh token response
    - looks the same as the original authorization token grant
- flow
    1. client send refresh token request (and optionally its own authentication
       details)
    1. server checks the refresh token is valid, client authentication is valid
       and the scope matches the original scope

### Native apps

The spec says that native apps have two choices

1. External user-agent
    - aka user the device web browser
    - ++ users _might_ be able to use existing sessions or password managment to
      help them auth
    - -- kind of a shitty UX to flip between apps
    - the native app registers a URL scheme with the OS that will cause it to be
      invoked when that type of URL is redirected to
    - workflow
        1. send uwer from app to browser
        1. user authenticates in browser and grants access to the app
        1. authorization server redirects browser to a URL scheme that will
           cause it to re-open the native app
        1. native app reads the tokens from the redirect URI
2. Embedded user-agent
    - aka webview
    - ++ keeps the user in the app
    - -- they don't get to re-use any sessions they might have in main browser

Spec recommend

- native apps using authorization code grant should not authenticate themselves
  because they can't store a secret safely
- when using implicit grant flow a refresh token should not be returned

### Anatomy of an access token

- a string representing an authorization issued to the client-app
    - has scopes
    - has a duration
    - resource owner who granted it
- provides an abstraction layer over the authorization required to get access to
  the protected resource
- is usually opaque to the client (but not always???)
- two forms
    - it may be a string that can be used by the resource server to look up the
      details of the authorization
    - it may contain the authorization details embedded in the string and signed
- details are not defined in the main RFC
    - RFC6750 has more details on the format of access tokens
- token analogy
    - access token is like a session
    - refresh token is like a password

Tokens can be

- passed by value
    - all the information required is embedded in the token
- passed by reference
    - a reference/pointer to the acutal data
    - for these, the resource server has to make a call to the authorization
      server to "dereference it" and check that the user is authorized

#### Types of token (Token profiles)

There are two common token profiles

1. Bearer tokens
    - a bit like cash
    - it has the issuer on there, the merchant you are transacting with is happy
      to take it because they trust the issuer
    - You can think of bearer tokens like cash. If you find a dollar bill on the
      ground and present it at a shop, the merchant will happily accept it. She
      looks at the issuer of the bill, and trusts that authority. The saleswomen
      doesn’t care that you found it somewhere. Bearer tokens are the same. The
      API gets the bearer token and accepts the contents of the token because it
      trusts the issuer (the OAuth server). The API does not know if the client
      presenting the token really is the one who originally obtained it. This
      may or may not be a bad thing. Bearer tokens are helpful in some cases,
      but risky in others. Where some sort of proof that the client is the one
      to who the token was issued for, HoK tokens should be used.
2. Holder of Key (HoK) tokens (still in draft)
    - a bit like a credit card
    - ties the holder to the token
    - merchant has to ask for identification as the token is presented
    - HoK tokens are like a credit card. If you find my credit card on the
      street and try to use it at a shop, the merchant will (hopefully) ask for
      some form of ID or a PIN that unlocks the card. This extra credential
      assures the merchant that the one presenting the credit card is the one to
      whom it was issued. If your API requires this sort of proof, you will need
      HoK key tokens. This profile is still a draft, but you should follow this
      before doing your own thing.

The OAuth spec does not say what kind of tokens are exchanged - there are many
possible tokens you can use with OAuth e.g.

- WS-Security
- SAML
- JWT

This token flexibility simplifies integration for enterprises.

### Aside: JSON identity protocol suite

- Suite of JSON based identity protocols
    - Tokens (JWT)
        - pronounced "jot"
        - lightweight, designed to be passed in HTTP headers and query strings
            - more suitable for IoT and mobile devices
        - Akin to SAML tokens
            - less expressive
            - less security options
            - more compact
            - encoded w. JSON not XML
    - Keys (JWK)
    - Algorithms (JWA)
    - Encrpytion (JWE)
    - Signatures (JWS)
- The bearer token spec explains how to use with OAuth
- these are being defined in the IETF

"nonce" stands for "not more than once"

### Anatomy of a refresh token

- a string
- used to obtain access tokens
- issued to the client by the authorization server at the same time the access
  token is issue
    - issued as the response to the authorization grant sent by the client
- refresh tokens are only sent to the authorization server - they are never sent
  to the resource server
- the authorization server may send a new refresh token and access token when it
  receieves a refresh token
    - allows the auth server to extend the lifetime of the authorization
      provided it is being used
- uses
    - obtain a new access token when the current one becomes invalid or expires
    - obtain new access tokens with identical or narrower scope (either in
      resources available or duration)
- usually opaque to the client

OAuth used HTTP redirects a lot _ authorization server redirects the
resource-owners user-agent to a different destination _ client-app redirects the
resource-owners user-agent to a different destination

The requirement for profiles

- OAuth 2 (the spec) on its own is a framework not a way to build interoperable
  security systems
- You must use the defined profiles to build real systems

### Client registration process

- Before the protocol it is assume that the client has already registered with
  the authorization server
- _How_ registation happens is mostly outside of OAuth but there are some bits
  it needs in place:
    1. client type (confidential|public) - the client should say whether it can
       secure its credentials
        - "secure" is from the POV of the authorization server i.e. what level
          of compromised client credentials it is ok being exposed to.
    2. client redirection URIs
    3. Any other info required by the authorization server e.g.
        - app anme
        - website
        - description
        - logo
- Focusing on the redirection endpoint:
    - When does a client need to register a redirect URI?
        - registration of a redirection endpoint is _required_ for
            - public clients
            - confidential clients using the implicit grant type
        - registration of a redirection endpoint is _optional_ for
            - confidential clients using the authorization-code grant type
            - even then the spec recommends all authorization servers require
              registration
    - It is allowed for the client to register multiple redirection endpoints
        - ??? usage example ???
- examples
    - creating a Facebook app that allows your app (the "client") to access user
      data protected by facebooks resource servers.
- when a client is registered it gets a "client identifier" from the
  authorization server
    - this is a string (length decided and documented by server)
    - it is unique to the authorization server
    - it is NOT a secret - it is exposed to the resource owner
    - the authorization server should not be silly enough to use just the client
      identifier to authenticate the client

The spec does not ban unregistered clients but also doesn't define how things
might work with them except to say that _a security review is required_

TL;DR: All clients should be registered

### Client type and client profile

Client type

There are two kinds of client-type:

1. confidential
    - a client capable of secure client authentication e.g.
        - capable of securing the stored client credentials
        - capable of doing client auth in a way that doesn't compromise
          credentials
1. public
    - a client not capable of securing their credentials e.g. facebook SDK in
      native mobile app

The spec was designed for three client "profiles"

1. `web application`
    - client is a web server app
    - resource owner interfaces it via HTML
    - a confidential client
        - client credentials and access tokens are stored on server and not
          exposed to the resource owner
1. `user agent based application`
    - JS app
    - a public client
        - it runs in browser and credentials and access tokens sent to it are
          potentially exposed to the resource user
1. `native application`
    - a public client
        - protocol data and credentials are accessible to the resource owner
        - assumed that any client credentials can be extracted
        - dynamically issued credentials such as access tokens, refresh tokens
          can be somewhat secured
            - depends on the platform
            - maybe secured from other apps on platform or other servers the
              client interacts with

Ways a **registered** client may authenticate with an authorization server
(unregistered clients are undefined in the spec)

- If the client is confidential i.e. can be trusted with client authentication
  credentials
    - any suitable HTTP authentication method that the authorization server
      deems suitable is ok by the spec
    - HTTP basic auth is probably the most common - the spec goes into detail
      about how the client id and secret (password) should be encoded.
    - examples
        1. password
            - if the client has a password the then authorization server MUST
              allow it to submit that password via HTTP Basic auth
            - the spec says how the `client_id` (client identifier) and
              `client_secret` (password) are encoded for HTTP basic auth
                - see section 2.3.1
            - authorization server must require TLS for endpoints sending client
              authentication info
            - authorization server should protect against brute force attacks on
              that endpoint
                - ??? how does doorkeeper do this ???
        2. public/private keypair
            - mentioned but no details given
            - TODO: find out more, is this used, if so where?
- If the client is public
    - section 2 has nothing to say about this case ...

### Authorization server endpoints

The authorization process uses up to two authorization server endpoints and one
client endpoint:

- Authorization server
    1. Authorization endpoint
        - used by the client to obtain authorization from the resource owner via
          user-agent redirection
        - used in grant type flows:
            - authorization code
            - implicit
    2. Token endpoint
        - the client must have authenticated itself with the authorization
          server _before_ it hits the token endpoint
        - used by the client to exchange an authorization grant or refresh token
          for an access token
            - "typically wtih client authentication" ????
                - does that mean the client has to authenticate itself with the
                  authorization server before hitting this endpoint????
        - used for every grant type except _implicit_.
        - client use use HTTP POST method to get access tokens
        - spec does not specify a way for the client to figure out the URI of
          the token endpoint - it is usually hardcoded
- Client
    1. Redirection endpoint
        - Used by the authorization server to return responses containaing
          authorization credentaisl to the client via th resource owner
          user-agent

- Not every authorization grant type uses both endpoints
- Spec allows extensible grant types to define their own endpoints

#### Anatomy of the scope parameter

Both authorisation server endpoints (authorization, token) allow the client to
provide a "scope" parameter

If the client provides a scope parameter, the server will return the scope in
the respone to indicate to the client which scopes it actually got.

A "scope" is

- a space delimited set of strings
- order does not matter
- defines the access the client wants

If the client does not send a scope parameter the server should fall back to a
default scope

Scopes are a way of the client requiesting access to a subset of the access it
_could_ get.

## How multiple redirect_uri work

- Most OAuth2 authorization services allow you to specify multiple
  `redirect_uri` values when you register your client application
- These are the list of "legal" redirect URIs that the server should accept for
  your client application
- The spec (3.1.2.2) says that
    - the server should force you to register the full URI
      `scheme://authority/path?query` so you can only vary the `state` query
      parameter.
    - but at the very least it should force you to register
      `scheme://authority/path`

The `redirect_uri` is sent from client to authorization server twice during the
authorization code flow:

1. `redirect_uri` 1 == the client sends to authorization server when trying to
   get the authorization code
2. `redirect_uri` 2 == the client sends to authorization server when trying to
   exchange authorization code for access token

Not all providers perform exact matches of the redirect URI, although the spec
requires it. To counter this the spec tries to add a layer of security by having
the server check that the second `redirect_uri` it gets matches the first and
also that they match one of the registered URIs.

### Controversy around OAuth2

- From the lead author:
  http://hueniverse.com/2012/07/26/OAuth-2-0-and-the-road-to-hell/

> When compared with OAuth 1.0, the 2.0 specification is more complex, less
> interoperable, less useful, more incomplete, and most importantly, less
> secure.

> It is this extensibility and required flexibility that destroyed the protocol.
> With very little effort, pretty much anything can be called OAuth 2.0
> compliant.

> What 2.0 offers is a blueprint for an authorization protocol. As defined, it
> is largely useless and must be used with profiles to become a working solution
> – and that is the enterprise way.

### APIs using OAuth 2.0
