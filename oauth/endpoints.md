# OAuth2 endpoints

There are three endpoints involved in OAuth2

- two on the auth server
    1. authorization endpoint (`/oauth/authorize` in doorkeeper)
        - MUST use TLS/SSL
        - MUST support GET
        - MAY support POST
    1. token endpoint (`/oauth/token` in doorkeeper)
- one on the client
    1. redirect endpoint
        - MUST be an absolute URL
        - MAY have a query string
        - MUST NOT have a fragment

Different flows use different endoints

- Authorizaiton code
    - uses all three endpoints
- Implicit
    - uses all three endpoints
- Resource owner password credentials
    - uses only token endpoint on auth server
- Client credentials
    - uses only token endpoint on auth server

## endpoints provided by doorkeeper but not in spec

- `/oauth/token/info`
    - can be used by a token holder to verify token e.g. resource server can
      verify tokens here
- `/oauth/revoke`
    - can be used to revoke a token
