## Terminology

* band
    * refers to a wide channel of frequencies
    * currently either 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz
* channel
    * each band contains many channels
* spatial stream/data stream
    * most phones/laptops support two streams, modern high end devices (e.g.
      macbook pro) support three
* MIMO
    * ???
    >  The number of antennas and streams is usually indicated by numbers like
    >  2×2 (two antennas for receiving and two for transmitting) or 3×3.
    >  Generally speaking, the more antennas you have, the more data streams
    >  the router can deliver and the more devices it can support at the same
    >  time.
* spatial multiplexing
    * ???
* diversity
    * ???

> On an 802.11ac router or extender, the 5GHz band is the one that actually
> operates at 802.11ac speeds; the 2.4GHz band runs at the same speed as
> 802.11n.

> the 5GHz band because its data rate is roughly triple that of the 2.4GHz
> band, making it a much better backhaul for wireless-ac routers and
> extenders—and the only way to get the best speed for wired devices connected
> to your extender.

QUESTION: does a device typically have one radio per band?

## Repeaters

Statements I'm not sure about:

> Cheap extenders like Amazon’s current best seller are almost all terrible,
> since they are single-band and have no way to avoid the performance penalty.
> Dual-band extenders are superior. Some give you an option right in their
> settings menu to connect to the router on one band and output a Wi-Fi network
> on the other band;

> On top of that, an extender should support at least two spatial streams (also
> called data streams) on each band.

> A WiFi Repeater effectively contains two wireless routers, similar to the
> wireless router you already have in your home or office. One of these
> wireless routers picks up the existing WiFi network. It then transfers the
> signal to the other wireless router, which transmits the boosted signal.

> All WiFi repeaters have some speed loss , but some are much worse than others.

> WiFi repeaters work by receiving wireless signal and rebroadcasting it, but
> single band repeaters have to receive, then retransmit each packet of data
> using the same radio on the same channel. This can cost single band repeaters
> 50% of their bandwidth.

> Dual band repeaters get around this by connecting to the router on one band
> and outputting a WiFi signal on the other.

> One final feature that helps reduce speed loss is dual radios. If the device
> has dual radios, it can speak to the main router on lower channels, and then
> rebroadcast on higher channels. One Wi-Fi radio receives the signal and the
> other radio rebroadcasts the boosted signal. This clever design allows the
> boosted signal to utilize a different WiFi channel, which greatly increases
> performance compared to single radio repeaters.

> an extender should support at least two spatial streams (also called data
> streams) on each band.  The vast majority of laptops, phones, and tablets
> support one or two streams; high-end laptops such as the MacBook Pro support
> three. You’ll get the best performance when your extender supports at least
> as many streams as your router and devices, and our pick can handle the
> fastest speeds of most routers and devices you’re likely to own.
