## Cache-control

    Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate

- a `,` separated list of "cache response directives"

Cache response directives

- private|public
    - asks intermediary caches not to cache the response
- no-cache
    - asks caches to re-validate the resource evyer time using the Etag header
- no-cache: field1
    - ok to cache the resource if the field1 field is stripped out
    - not all user agents support it
- no-store
    - asks cache not to store any part of the request OR the response
- max-age
    - overrides the `Expires` header
    - a number of seconds that that response can be cached for
- s-max-age
    - a header designed to talk to CDNs and other intermediary caches
    - well behaved CDNs will honor it
    - it overrides `max-age` response directive and `Expires` header if they
      exist
- must-revalidate
    - ask the cache to never serve stale content
    - the client is required to send the reqest headers back and check that the
      content is not stale
- no-transform
    - ask proxies not to convert image, video formats etc.
- proxy-revalidate
    - could have been called `s-must-revalidate`
    - aimed at proxies and CDNs rather than clients

## Expires

- the traditional way to set expiry
- is overridden by the `Cache-control` header
- good to set this too for compatibility
- date format is fixed
- Rails does not seem to set this
