## Overview

- R is a bit like old-school JS
    - Bit crusty as a language but lots of libs/frameworks have evolved to work
      around it's crustier bits
- A huge amount of the momentum in the R community seems to be around Rstudio
  and Tidyverse
    - Without it R would be quite crusty and **much** harder to interface with
      other stuff
- Around since the late 1990s
- Aside: Intel _Math Kernel Library_
    - [Intel MKL](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl)
    - MKL is a cross-platform C lib of math routines optimized for Intel
      processors
    - has C and Fortran interfaces
- Distros of R
    - CRAN https://cran.r-project.org/ _ "CRAN R" does not bind to
      [Intel MKL](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl) libs for matrix
      operations _ If you want to do matrix operations efficiently in R then the
      Microsoft version of R is recommended
    - MRAN https://mran.microsoft.com/ _ Officially supports Windows and Linux.
      _ macOS homebrew has `microsoft-r-open` package but it crashes on launch
      for me in Catalina \* Microsoft R Open is a downstream distribution of R
      with added components. As a result it is 100% compatible with the latest
      version of R, and will continue to be so.
- R consortium
    - manages CRAN the package manager
- purpose
    - statistical analysis
    - data manipulation
- culture
    - stable, they don't "move fast and break things"
    - Rstudio is the standard IDE (seems to be the "photoshop" of the R world)
    - lots of users use R in Rstudio without thinking of themselves as
      "programmers"
- is great at
    - rectanglar data with different types from database/spreadsheet/files
- not ideal for
    - running numerical simulations - use Python for this instead
    - There are lots of datasets that are not naturally rectangular including
      images, sounds, trees, and text.
        - R might not be the best choice for these but I'm not sure about that
- has muiltiple implemenations of the _data frame_ idea
    1. base R data frame
        - dated, has some irritating features
        - indexes by column then row
        - fine for datasets that can fit in memory or be loaded incrementally
          from a datastore like a DB (up to a few GB depending on your box)
    1. tibble data frame (from tidyverse)
        - indexes by column then row
        - fine for datasets that can fit in memory or be loaded incrementally
          from a datastore like a DB (up to a few GB depending on your box)
    1. datatable
        - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html
        - designed for huge datasets
        - indexes by row then column (sometimes used on small datasets by people
          who prefer this)
        - needed for datasets that can't fit in memory
- R has no native way to isolate packages to a single project
    - Packrat is an attempt to solve this
        - http://rstudio.github.io/packrat/
        - it vendors your packages into your project dir
    - renv is basically Packrat 2.0 and is probably what you should use
    - Note that rsconnect (the thing that publishes to shinyapps.io) does not
      support renv.lock
- All character strings in R stored in a single global hash (like symbols are in
  Ruby)
    - => more efficient for strings which appear a lot in data sets.
    - => No GC of string data - if you load lots of transient strings you'll
      probably eat memory ???
- tidyverse
    - started in 2015
    - a curated collection of modern R packages for data science
    - packages work together well
    - encourages the use of tibbles by default
    - tidyeval ???
    - packages included
        - purrr (functional programming toolkit) https://purrr.tidyverse.org/
            - defines a `%>%` pipeline operator
- there is also "validated" version of R called _ValidR_ for use environments
  which require that e.g. drug trials
    - https://www.mango-solutions.com/products/validr/
- an open source port of `S` lang (sometimes called "Gnu S")
- "has both functional and OO features"
    - I'm not sure author understands these words the same way I do
- has interactive sessions/repl
    - interactive mode saves command history
        - comments are saved in the command history (helps when trying to
          understand your history)
        - saves to `.Rdata` file in cwd
    - interactive mode prompts you to saves data sets between sessions too!
- like C `{}` can be omitted for single line blocks
    - unlike C you can do this for function definitions too
- assignment
    - operator is `<-` or `=` but `<-` is preferred because sometimes `=` does
      not work
        - TODO find out more about this
    - you can do assignment in the reverse direction but it is not recommended
      stylistically e.g. `c(1,3) -> foo` works
- line comments begin with `#`
- R has no scalar values
    - numbers are considered one element vectors
- variables do not have fixed types
- any value which can be assigned is called an "object"
    - all values have a "storage mode" which is basically the type. You can
      introspect it with `mode()`
    - all values have a ???
- `.` is not used for attribute reference or method calls - it is just a legal
  character in a variable name that is used to indicate some sort of heirarchy
  in the name
    - everything is pass by value which helps avoid bugs but is inefficient

## R types

- `NULL`
    - is returned by functions that don't explicitly return anything e.g.
      `print()`, `plot()`
- boolean
    - `TRUE` and `FALSE` (or `T` and `F` as shorthand)
- numbers
    - ?? R doesn't have a 64 bit integer type?
- vector
    - all elements must be same type (or "storage mode")
    - INTUITION WARNING: vector indices begin at 1 not 0
    - created with `c()` global function
    - can optionally have a name (string) associated with each element
- character strings
    - INTUITION WARNING: are NOT considered a vector of characters!
    - each string is a **single element** vector of mode character
        ```r
        > a <- "hello"
        > a
        [1] "hello"
        > mode(a)
        [1] "character"
        > a[1]
        [1] "hello"
        > a[2]
        [1] NA
        ```
- matrices
    - a vector that has also
        - a number of rows
        - a number of cols
    - all objects must be same type
        ```r
        > m <- rbind(c(1,4),c(5,7))
        > m
            [,1] [,2]
        [1,]    1    4
        [2,]    5    7
        ```
    - you can use the `,` within the square bracket notation to get a whole
      column or whole row
- functions
    - can have default args ` foo <- function(a=1, b=TRUE, c=F)`
    - function application is C alike
    - have implicit returns but you can use an explicit `return()` statement
        - doing so is recommended by style guides
    - can have generic functions (same function name does diff things for diff
      types) e.g. `plot()` will try to do something appropriate with its given
      data
    - IMPORTANT: R **copies** all arguments to functions
        - R is totally pass by value even for complex data structures
        - => functions can mutate their args and changes are ignored
        - this has performance implications!
- scoping
    - variables created outside functions are global
    - variables declared within a function are local to that function
    - a global var can be written from within a function using the "super
      assignment" operator `<<-`
- Style and linting
    - https://style.tidyverse.org/ seems to be the common one
        - google has a slight variation on it
    - autoformatter: http://styler.r-lib.org/ (formats to the tidyverse style
      guide)
    - linter: https://github.com/jimhester/lintr
- R startup
    - R sources quite a few files at startup which allow customisation of the
      environment
    - System Rprofile: `/usr/local/Cellar/r/3.6.2/lib/R/library/base/R/Rprofile`
    - Run `?Rprofile` in repl to get help about R startup
    - `~/.Rprofile` will run at startup and is the best place to put code for
      all your R projects
- Reading nviornment variables
    ```r
    Sys.getenv("R_PROFILE") # => ""
    Sys.getenv("R_HOME") # => "/usr/local/Cellar/r/3.6.2/lib/R"
    ```
- packages
    - install with `install.packages("name1", "name2")`
    - update with `update.packages(ask = FALSE)`
    - R packages seem to involve a lot of C compilation
        - my guess is the community drops back to C/C++ fairly readily
    - almost all R packages I installed seem to require C compilation
    - I installed:

        ```sh
        # data science
        tidyverse

        # better graphs
        ggplot2
        gridExtra

        # a package to accompany a book: # Companion to Applied Regression
        # I don't really know why I installed this - the book told me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
        car

        # web framework
        shiny
        ```

    - packages commands:
        ```r
        install.packages("nameofpackage")
        installed.packages()
        ```

- S3 and S4
    - some kind of objects ???
    - there are functions to test whether an object is S3 or S4 and to convert
      between them

## Accessors

R has three accessor operators

1. `[]`
    - the "subset" operator
    - often returns the same type but not always e.g. if you pull a column out
      of data frame you might get a vector (you can control this by adding
      `drop=FALSE` as an option)
    - mostly returns the same type as the object you run it on e.g. vectors
      return vectors, lists return lists.
        - An exception is that data frames sometimes return a different type
          e.g. it could return a vector - you can use `drop=FALSE` option to
          ensure it always returns a data frame
        ```r
        class(iris[, "Petal.Length", drop=FALSE])
        [1] "data.frame"
        > class(iris[, "Petal.Length"])
        [1] "numeric"
        ```
2. `[[]]`
    - extract **one** item
        - examples:
            - using it on a data frame gives you a vector
            - using it on a list gives you one element
            - using it on a vector gives you one element
    - ++ can use named or integer indices
    - ++ can interpolate variables to generate the index to find
    - the result can be a different type than the thing you run it on
    - you get back exactly **one** thing
3. `$`
    - a special case of `[[]]` where you use the name of a column or row
    - wrap names with special chars in backticks
    - -- cannot interpolate variables for the name of row or column
    - -- can only use named rows/cols - doesn't work with integer indices

Question: I'm not sure waht the diff is between them tbh

## Installation

```bash
# macOS

brew install r # CRAN R
brew cask install microsoft-r-open
```

## Getting help

```R
# get help about function
?funcName

# see examples
??funcName
```

## Introspection

```R
x <- c(1,44,55)

# can do basic introspection in the reply by just typing the name of the "object"
x
print(x) # same as above in the repl
# [1]  1 44 55

# str() prints a short summary of the structure of the object
str(x) # => "NULL"
# num [1:3] 1 44 55

# returns a string of a table of summary data
summary(x)

# generate the R code required to create this value
dput(x)
```

## Syntax examples

```R
# * c() concatenates vectors into a vector
# * assignment happens by <- or = (but <- is prefered because there are
#   situations where = will not work
x <- c(1,2,3)

x[1] # get first element of vector
x[2:3] # get range within vector


# functions
q() # quit - you will be given option to save workspace image (which includes command history)
source("path/to/file.R")
mean()
sd() # standard deviation
mode() # returns the "storage mode" (or type) of an object, does not calculate the statistical mode
print() # print to stdout
paste() # concatenate strings
strsplit() # split strings

rbind(v1, v2, ...) # build a matrix using provided vectors as rows
cbind(v1, v2, ...) # build a matrix using provided vectors as colums

print("hi")
# "hi"

# functions are created in a fairly normal way
foo <- function() {
  print("hi")
}

# return storage mode as a string
mode(foo)
# => "function"

# introspect the type
typeof(foo)
# => "function"

foo()
# "hi"

# variable names can be re-used
foo <- function(a) {
    print(a)
    print(mode(a))
}

foo(23)
# 23
# "numeric"

getwd()
[1] "/Users/eoinkelly/Dropbox/Eoin/Notes/on-github/R"

# generate a random uniform distribution
runif(20)
```

## Ingesting data

Remember you probably want `stringsAsFactors=FALSE` in these functions

```r
read.table()
read.csv()
data.frame()
```
