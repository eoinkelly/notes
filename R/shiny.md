# Shiny

Good resource: https://kellobri.github.io/shiny-prod-book/

- an R package
- lets you build web apps in R
- created by rstudio
    - who also have a package manager
- can output to:
    - host standalone apps on a webpage
    - embed them in _R markdown_ documents
    - build dashboards
- extend them with
    - CSS themes
    - htmlwidgets
    - JS actions

```r
install.packages("shiny")

# puts 'shiny' (on my machine) in:
# /usr/local/lib/R/3.6/site-library

# also installs the R dependencies
#     ‘Rcpp’, ‘BH’, ‘magrittr’, ‘httpuv’, ‘mime’, ‘jsonlite’, ‘xtable’,
#     ‘digest’, ‘htmltools’, ‘R6’, ‘sourcetools’, ‘later’, ‘promises’,
#     ‘crayon’, ‘rlang’, ‘fastmap’
```

- it compiles a bunch of C/C++ when you install shiny
- R is single threaded and R is the web server when you run shiny
- R uses CSV files for data out of the box but can be persuaded to use a SQL DB
- shiny has a bunch of compiled dependencies so a docker deploy might be a good
  idea
- it seems like interactive elements on the page send requests back ot the R
  process to get it to re-render data and send it back
- there is a testing framework looks a bit rudimentary - uses phantomjs
