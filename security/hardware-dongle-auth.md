# Hardware Dongle Authentication

_This is still a mess_

## Sources

- https://www.dongleauth.info/
    - Great list of which sites support hardware dongles and which protocols
      each dongle supports

## Jargon

- FIDO = Fast IDentity Online
    - a consortium of companies(seems to be mostly Banks and large tech
      companies)
        - not a standard but they do host standards so sometimes jargon is
          confusing

## Protocols

1. TOTP
    - Time based one time passwords
1. U2F
    - developed by Google and Yubikey
    - standard now hosted by the FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) consortium (seems
      to be mostly Banks and large tech companies)
    - includes CTAP
    - a standard for creating a better second factor - it assumes you are still
      using password as the first factor
1. CTAP
    - Client-to-Authenticator Protocols
    - can be used to authenticate a token via USB, near-field communication
      (NFC), or Bluetooth.
1. UAF
    - 2014
    - Universal Authentication Framework
1. Fido 1.0
    - FIDO 1.0 = UAF + U2F
1. WebAuthn
    - WebAuthn is an outgrowth of FIDO's U2F 2.0
    - Standardizes how users can loging to websites using public key crypto
    - Has good cross-browser support now (everything modern, not IE11 obvs)
        - https://caniuse.com/#search=webauthn
    - 1.0 spec has been release, 2.0 is in progress
1. CTAP2
    - An expansion of CTAP
1. FIDO 2
    - FIDO2 = WebAuthn + CTAP2
    - A protocol pushed by the FIDO alliance
    - backwards compatible with FIDO 1.0 (aka UAF + U2F)
    - A FIDO2 authenticator may be used in either single-factor mode or
      multi-factor mode. In single-factor mode, the authenticator is activated
      by a test of user presence, which usually consists of a simple button
      push. In multi-factor mode, the authenticator (something you have)
      performs user verification.

## State of play in 2020-06

Overall: Browser support is good but site support is very patchy

Summary

- Support is patchy across services
- Many services support them but not always fully
    - Some require you to have other forms of second factor available such as
      SMS e.g. Gmail
    - Some don't let you set the hardware keys as the default e.g. Facebook
    - Some don't let you remove other options e.g. Twitter, Dropbox

> In conclusion, we found that multi-factor authentication (2FA, but more
> accurately described) through a mobile app is much easier to set up, and more
> widely supported than hardware token-based U2F.

From my own testing, AWS don't allow you to register multiple keys - you can use
either TOTP _or_ Dongle but not both and you can't have multiple dongles

## Messy misc notes

- the specs emphasize a device centric model
- client can be installed at the OS or the web browser level
- FIDO has some protocols which work over bluetooth and NFC

For the whole thing to work

1. The website/service must support U2F
1. Your browser must support U2F (currently only Chrome, Firefox, Opera. Edge
   and Safari are working on it)
1. You must have a U2F device
    - plugs into your computer via USB (mimics a keyboard using HID)
    - The device has a private key embedded at manufacture/provision time
    - You have to trust that the manufacturer won't make duplicates

Prices on 2018-08-15

- Yubikey 4 = $86 NZD
- Yubico security key = $232 NZD

## Yubico devices

- https://www.yubico.com/product/yubikey-4-series/
    - Supported protocols:
        - FIDO U2F
        - smart card (PIV)
        - Yubico OTP
        - OpenPGP
        - OATH-TOTP
        - OATH-HOTP
        - and Challenge-Response
    - so it supports heaps of protocols

- OTP (One time passwords)
    - the second factor comes from a thing the user carries with them - can be a
      phone, yubikey etc.
    - downsides
        - somewhat involved for users to set it up
        - manufacturers often posess the seed values for tokens
        - yubikey OTP codes can be 32 chars vs 6
        - secrets need to be stored on servers

> The increasing sophistication of attacks against OTP schemes was a motivating
> factor in the development of the FIDO U2F protocol

> When a user registers a U2F device with an online service, a public/private
> key pair is generated

> After registration, when the user attempts to log in, the service provider
> sends a challenge to the client. The client compiles information about the
> source of the challenge, among other information. This is signed by the U2F
> device (using the private key) and sent back to the server (service provider).

Real-time challenge-response schemes like U2F address OTP vulnerabilities such
as phishing and various forms of man-in-the-middle attacks. As the legitimate
server is issuing the challenge, if a rogue site or middle-man manipulates the
flow, the server will detect an abnormality in the response and deny the
transaction.

Advantages of U2F include:

Strong security from public key cryptography. Easy to use with no codes to
re-type and no drivers to install. High privacy so that no personal information
is associated with a key. Unlimited usage in that an unlimited number of
accounts can be protected by one single device.

Chrome browser is the only available client

- Firefox now supports it but
    - Mozilla plans to only support the out-of-the-box experience with FIDO U2F
      devices using Web Authentication APIs (as part of FIDO 2) versus FIDO U2F
      APIs.

In many ways, FIDO 2 is the next-generation of FIDO U2F, as it will pave the way
for things like multi-factor and passwordless login, while still supporting
two-factor authentication (2FA) functionalities of the original FIDO U2F
standard. As Web Authentication specifications will likely not be complete until
early 2018, users will need to wait for the seamless experience with U2F devices
in Firefox until the Web Authentication API integration is done.

Firefox 60 is the first browser to support the new security standard, FIDO2, Web
Authentication (WebAuthn) and U2F.

> the WebKit team has decided not to officially support U2F, because they
> consider it a Chrome-only hack, rather than a standardized API. See this and
> previous messages. They're working on the Web Authentication API instead
