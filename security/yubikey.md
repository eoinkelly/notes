Yubikey recommend you add 2 security keys to services in case you lose one (well
they would wouldn't they)

Dropbox _ you can add a key but only after you have added an authenticator app.
you cannot remove the authenticator app _ uses ??? protocol

Chrome/Google _ uses U2F _ requires you to have the SMS 2factor enabled but you
can add key

AWS _ uses ??? protocol _ only allows you to have one second factor device!
