# NZISM


Which bits can I ignore because we don't run data centers?

## Overview

23 sections

Sections most applicable to creating web apps and their infra:

4 - know the C&A process agencies will need to follow
5 - know the docs agencies are expected to create/maintain
14


> Agencies engaging industry for the provision of off-site information technology services and functions MUST accredit the systems used by the contractor to at least the same minimum standard as the agency&#x2019;s systems. This may be achieved through a third party review report utilising the ISAE 3402 Assurance Reports on Controls at a Third Party Service Organisation.
might be relevant for us

## Section 1

NZISM Contains

1. Processes
1. Controls

at levels

1. Essential Baseline processes and controls
1. Recommended Good practice processes and controls


Data classifications (not defined in NZISM but heavily referenced)

1. UNCLASSIFIED
1. IN-CONFIDENCE
1. SENSITIVE
1. RESTRICTED
1. CONFIDENTIAL
1. SECRET
1. TOP SECRET

_All Classifications_ is anything which has been marked with one of the above or is "Official Information"

NZISM defines a minimum set of controls for each level of data classification

Uses RFC 2119 definitons to say what compliance is required e.g. MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT

In opinion of NZISM, Anything with a MUST  is a risk which cannot be managed by an agency, thigns with a SHOULD are risks that can be managed

In cases where the manual cannot be fully complied with, the risk assessment should talk about _compensating controls_ and the acceptance of the residual risk
i.e. if you can't comply for some reason you need to provide a risk assessment of why
