# Managing tainted input

Input scrubbing is hard to get right \* they can encode as hex in UTF-8 or other
text encoding

Techniques for input scrubbing

1. Whitelisting
    - Map the input to some safe input using a case statement or Hash lookup
    - ++ input from user never makes it past the whitelist lookup
    - -- only works when the no. of valid inputs is very constrained
1. Escaping
    - -- frail
    - -- usually DB specific
1. Escaping by hex encoding
    - you hex encode all strings before sending them to the DB. Your query has
      to wrap them in a `hex_decode()` function of some sort.
    - a sub case of escaping
    - -- still frail
    - ++ the string you send contains only 0-9a-f
    - -- This does not always work
        - WHY?
    - -- does not protect you from second order SQLi
        - it may prevent DB from running the user supplied content as SQL this
          time but it will still be stored in DB

Techniques for avoiding input scrubbing

- avoid blacklisting of certain character sequences
    - `SELECT` can be `SeLeCt` and ` OR 1=1` can be ` OR 2=2` etc.
    - can put non standard characters between expressions
      `SELECT\*blah*\username,password\*foo*\FROM users;`
    - insert a null byte to make parser think string has ended e.g.
      `%00<script>alert('stuff');</script>`
