# multipart/form-data

- This encoding must be used when you are uploading a file via HTML form
- Uses mimetype `multipart/form-data`
- your HTML form must specify `enctype="multipart/form-data"` to choose this
  encoding
- most server-side libs transparently handle forms encoded with this or the
  default `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` encoding
- the encoded output looks a lot like Mime encoded attachments in email
    - not a concidence - once upon a time you could submit HTML forms via email
- `Content-Type` header of the request specifies the mimetype AND the string to
  use for boundary

    Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=SOME_BOUNDARY_STRING
