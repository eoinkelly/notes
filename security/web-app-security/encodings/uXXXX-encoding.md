# %uXXXX encoding

- Non standard - do not use in dev work.
- `%uXXXX` where `XXXX` is the UTF-16 code unit represented as 4 hex digits
- WARNING: not specified by any RFC
- It was considered for the IRI (internationalized version of URI) by W3C but
  rejected because:
    > Instead of using the existing percent-encoding convention of URIs, which
    > is based on octets, the idea was to create a new encoding convention, for
    > example to use '%u' to introduce UCS code points. Using the existing
    > octet-based percent-encoding mechanism does not need an upgrade of the URI
    > syntax, and does not need corresponding server upgrades.
- Should not be used to encode characters - instead encode them as UTF-8 and
  prefix each hex pair with %
- it may have security/pen testing uses if software supports it for legacy
  reasons
