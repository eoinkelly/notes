# x-www-form-urlencoded encoding

- uses the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` media type
- is defined in the HTML, XForms, CGI specs (specs are defined in an "outdated
  manner"0
- is _mostly_ the same as URL encoding but has some modifications
    - replace space with `+` instead of `%20`
    - "newline normalization"
- uses
    - body of HTTP POST message
    - technically HTML forms can be submitted via email too and it can be used
      in this
