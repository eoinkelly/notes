- WireGuard securely encapsulates IP packets over UDP.
- is a linux kernel module written in C
    - they hope to be included in mainline kernel eventually
- the project has userland implementations in rust and go
    - wireshark-go (intended for use on macOS , Windows, `*BSD` - currently not
      complete)
    - wireshark-rs
        - https://github.com/WireGuard/wireguard-rs
        - The current plan is to target macOS (utun-compatible operating
          systems) for simplicity, but full cross-platform support is the
          eventual goal
        - seems less complete than the go version
