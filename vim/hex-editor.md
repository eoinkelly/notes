# Make vim be a somewhat competent hex editor

- `:setlocal display=uhex` causes vim to show nonprinting characters as their
  byte values which makes into a bit of a hex editor. It is great for digesting
  data that is mostly printable chars but has some non-printing bits.
- `:help dy` to see the help
