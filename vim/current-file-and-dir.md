# Getting current file and dir on command line

## command mode (after `:`)

Ctrl-R then % will paste the path (relative to vim starting dir) to current file
onto the command line

## insert mode

Ctrl-R then % will paste the path (relative to vim starting dir) to current file
into the file the the cursor

## normal mode

Ctrl-G " display path in status line 1 then Ctrl-G` will display the full path
to the file in status line

## general

- the % register contains the relative (to vim start dir) path of the current
  file
- register # contains the name of the alternate file.
- you can paste from these registers just like any other register

For example, in directory /abc the command vim def/my.txt would edit file
/abc/def/my.txt. The following commands could be entered to display the
information shown.

:echo @% def/my.txtdirectory/name of fi le :echo expand('%:t') my.txtname of
file ('tail') :echo expand('%:p' ) /abc/def/my.txtfull path :echo
expand('%:p:h') /abc/defdirectory containing file ('head')

The following commands insert lines consisting of the full path of the current
and alternate files into the buffer:

:put =expand('%:p') :put =expand('#:p')

Some example shortcuts

```vim

" Make %% expand (on the command line) into the containing path of the currently open buffer
cnoremap %% <C-R>=expand('%:h').'/'<cr>

" full path to the dir vim was opened with
:inoremap \fp <C-R>=getcwd()<CR>
"/Users/eoinkelly/Dropbox/Notes/on-github

" current filename without extension
:inoremap \fn <C-R>=expand("%:t:r")<CR>

" current filename with extension
:inoremap \fn <C-R>=expand("%:t")<CR>

" full path to current dir
:inoremap \fn <C-R>=expand("%:p:h")<CR>

" path to current dir relative to the dir vim was opened with
:inoremap \fn <C-R>=expand("%:h")<CR>
" vim
```
