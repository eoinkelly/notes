## Higher level tools

- adduser
- addgroup

Reasons to use the higher level tools

- they automatically follow Debian policy for UID and GID values
- they create a home dir for the new user with skeletal configuration

## Low level tools

- useradd
- usermod
- groupadd

The lower level tools cover some edge-cases that aren't possible to cover with
the higher level tools.
