# Ruby & Rails resource usage

- 80 MB seems to be a minimum for a bare-bones rails app
- up to 250 MB is apparently normal in production for real apps

- Rails code loading is different in dev and production
- rails will use more memory when you have hit various parts of the app
- it should level off after that
- ~100ms response time for requests is what the big sites aim for
- A user navigating around wants to get from page to page in <1 sec so counting
  network latency etc. 100ms seems like a great goal

## Running minimal ruby process on mac

```rb
# minimal program used to test bare ruby sized
loop do; end
```

```
Ruby 2.2.2. running minial program above takes up 4.8 MB memory (4.7 compressed) and starts 2 threads and opens 13 ports
    real: 2.1 MB
    private: 0 KB
    shared: 2.1 MB

Ruby 2.2.2 running rails server via webrick takes 83.3 MB memory, 2 threads, 16 ports
    real: 5.6 MB
    private: 486 KB
    shared: 3.9 MB
```
