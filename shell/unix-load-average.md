# Unix Load averages

- Load "average" over 1, 5, 15 mins - it is the _average_ no. of "jobs" in the
  "run queue"
- It is not strictly an "average" - strictly speaking the values are calculated
  by an exponential decay function but for our purposes we can consider it an
  "average"

# CPU percentage

> top reports that your program is taking 45% CPU, 45% of the samples taken by
> top found your process active on the CPU. The rest of the time your
> application was in a wait.

It is measuring processes that are marked running or uninterruptible.

On a single CPU/core machine

- 0.0 means no jobs are going through the CPU
- 1.0 means that single CPU is exactly at capacity
- 1+ means that jobs are waiting to get on the CPU

If you have 4 cores then 4.0 would be all 4 cores exactly at capacity

Rules of thumb:

1. No. of cores = max load
2. Cores are cores
    - Roughly speaking a 4 processor of 1 core machine == 1 processor of 4 core
      machine
3. 0.7 per core/cpu is about the most you want in reality as it gives you some
   headroom
4. 1.0 per core is too high for comfort
5. 5.0 or above for core is a really serious problem
6. The 5 and 15 min averages matter more than the 1 min (which could be a short
   spike)

For a 2 core server:

- 1.4 is the max 5 or 15 min average you would want to see regularly
- 2.0 is the CPU at max capacity

Both `top` and `uptime` show load averages.

# Find no. of cores a system has

To find out how many cores your system has:

```
# Linux
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo

# Mac
$ sysctl hw.ncpu
$ sysctl -n hw.ncpu' # gets just number, handy to use programmatically
```
