# Unix % CPU usage

* CPU is the percentage of the time period specified by the counting mode that the processor spent in various work.
* A CPU core is either totally busy or totally idle at any moment in time.
* CPU% usage is calculated by asking the core at regular intervals whether is busy or not and tallying the no. of times it said yes!

From linux top command:

```

It seems that linux shows more detail than mac on this

* linux
    * "tasks" are processes
        * sleeping ???
        * running ??
        * stopped ??
        * zombie ???
    * CPU time breack down - see http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/18920 :
        * us: user cpu time (or) % CPU time spent in user space
        * sy: system cpu time (or) % CPU time spent in kernel space
        * ni: user nice cpu time (or) % CPU time spent on low priority processes
        * id: idle cpu time (or) % CPU time spent idle
        * wa: io wait cpu time (or) % CPU time spent in wait (on disk)
            * Prior to Linux 2.5.41, included in idle.
            * QUESTION: why is the SPU waiting, surely waiting things would not be scheduled on it?
            * QUESTION: mac does not show waiting time as separate thing - is this because the kernel reports it differently?
        * hi: hardware irq (or) % CPU time spent servicing/handling hardware interrupts
            * hi is the time spent processing hardware interrupts. Hardware
              interrupts are generated by hardware devices (network cards,
              keyboard controller, external timer, hardware senors, ...) when
              they need to signal something to the CPU (data has arrived for
              example). Since these can happen very frequently, and since they
              essentially block the current CPU while they are running, kernel
              hardware interrupt handlers are written to be as fast and simple
              as possible.
        * si: software irq (or) % CPU time spent servicing/handling software interrupts
            * If long or complex processing needs to be done, these tasks are
              deferred using a mechanism call softirqs. These are scheduled
              independently, can run on any CPU, can even run concurrently (non
              of that is true of hardware interrupt handlers).
        * st: steal time - - % CPU time in involuntary wait by virtual cpu while
            hypervisor is servicing another processor (or) % CPU time stolen
            from a virtual only relevant in virtualized environments.  It
            represents time when the real CPU was not available to the
            current virtual machine - it was "stolen" from that VM by the
            hypervisor (either to run another VM, or for its own needs).

```
us -- User CPU time
The time the CPU has spent running users' processes that are not niced.
sy -- System CPU time
The time the CPU has spent running the kernel and its processes.
ni -- Nice CPU time
The time the CPU has spent running users' proccess that have been niced.
wa -- iowait
Amount of time the CPU has been waiting for I/O to complete.
hi -- Hardware IRQ
The amount of time the CPU has been servicing hardware interrupts.
si -- Software Interrupts
The amount of time the CPU has been servicing software interrupts.
st -- Steal Time
The amount of CPU 'stolen' from this virtual machine by the hypervisor for other tasks (such as running another virtual machine).

NOTE: st time is significant for our VMs as it indicates time that wasn't available to us
