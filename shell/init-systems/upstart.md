# upstart

- Upstart has been replaced by systemd on Ubuntu
- It was used by (at least) red-hat and ubuntu
    - ubuntu 14 used it (15+ moved to systemd)

> Upstart is an event-based replacement for the /sbin/init daemon which handles
> starting of tasks and services during boot, stopping them during shutdown and
> supervising them while the system is running.
>
> It was originally developed for the Ubuntu distribution, but is intended to be
> suitable for deployment in all Linux distributions as a replacement for the
> venerable System-V init.
