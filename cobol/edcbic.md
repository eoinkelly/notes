# EBCDIC Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code

- sometimes pron. "ebb-ce-dic"

> While IBM was a chief proponent of the ASCII standardization committee,[4] the
> company did not have time to prepare ASCII peripherals (such as card punch
> machines) to ship with its System/360 computers, so the company settled on
> EBCDIC

> All IBM mainframe and midrange operating systems use EBCDIC as their inherent
> encoding[5] (with toleration for ASCII, for example, ISPF in z/OS can browse
> and edit both EBCDIC and ASCII encoded files)

> The most common newline convention used with EBCDIC is to use a NEL (NEXT
> LINE) code between lines. Converters to other encodings often replace NEL with
> LF or CR/LF, even if there is a NEL in the target encoding. This causes the LF
> and NEL to translate to the same character and be unable to be distinguished.

- EBCDIC is an acronym for Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code.
- It is a single byte (8 bit) character encoding standard that is used in the
  IBM mainframe environment
- IBM didn't invent just one version of EBCDIC either but several different
  incompatible versions.
