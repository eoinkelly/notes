# The pyramid principle

Writing is like serialising a complex structure into a linear format. Readers
are forced to:

1. read one sentence at a time
1. comprehend it
1. fit it into the thought structure they are building based on the sentences
   they have seen so far

This is easier for them if the ideas come at them in the shape of a pyramid
starting at the top.

The book suggests that our minds sort sentences into pyramids of ideas to
understand them. Written documents should be deliberately structured to help the
reader build that pyramid

Human brains are pattern matching machines. When we hear a sequence of ideas we
try to pattern match to impose a logical pattern on them.

Our minds use pyramids so that:

1. we can stop at magical no. 7

- There is a limit to the number of ideas we can hold in short-term memory at
  one time
- somewhere between 5-9 depending on the person, 7 as an median
- this means that our minds are always trying to group the items together into
  logical categories so they can be retained as new ideas arrive
- i.e. try to find an abstraction over a group of items and just keep the
  abstraction in working memory
- A "grouping and summarizing" process
- a person will already have pyramids of ideas, the writer is trying to slot the
  new information into existing pyramids

2. state the logic of the relationship

- the groupings have a logic relating them
- a way the ideas are related
- eoin: this not explained well yet

The challenge of writing is to communicate a pyramid of ideas from your head to
theirs by serialising them into sentences.

## Order ideas from the top down

> Controlling the sequence in which you present your ideas is the single most
> important act necessary for clear writing

The clearest sequence is always to **give the summarizing idea before you give
the individual ideas being summarized**

If you present your underlying ideas first, the reader/listener's mind will be
trying to build a pyramid from them and fit them into their existing pyramids
they may not build the pyramid you are trying to communicate to them! Or they
might not see any relationship between the ideas so they can't retain more than
7ish of them Your summarizing idea should tell the reader how to connect the
ideas which follow. Of course then the ideas which follow should be able to be
connected using your suggested relationship - don't present other ideas. If you
give your summarizing idea first then you are telling them in advance what the
relationship is so there is a better chance they will build the pyramid you are
trying to communicate

A paragraph is a **single idea** All the sentences in a paragraph should be
there to explain the idea of the paragraph the sentences should be just what is
needed to defend the **single** idea of the paragraph if your summary sentence
is hard to write it might be that the paragraph needs to be refactored

A section is a **single idea** The paragraphs in the section are what is needed
(no more, no less) to explain the single idea of the section The paragraph
summary sentences are the ideas needed to support the section

A document is a **single idea**

1. Ideas at any level of the pyramid must be summaries of the ideas grouped
   below them (i.e. the document idea is a summary of the **grouping** of the
   ideas in the lower sections
2. Ideas in each grouping must always be the same kind of idea

- if the first idea in the grouping is a "reason for doing something" then the
  other ideas should also be
- if the first idea is a step in the process then the other ideas should also be
  steps
- if the first idea is a problem then the other steps should be problems too
- a shortcut in checking your groupings is to see if they can be refered to as a
  single plural noun e.g. "recommendations", "problems", "reasons", "necessary
  changes"

3. Ideas in each grouping must be logically ordered

- there must be a specific reason why the second idea comes after the first and
  not third
- There are only 4 ways to logically order ideas:
    1. Deductively (major premise, minor premise, conclusion)
    2. Chronologically (first, second, third)
    3. Structurally (Boston, New York, Washington)
    4. Comparatively (first most important, second most important, ...)
- the order you choose reflects the thinking process you used to form the
  grouping
    - if you formed the grouping deductively, the ideas go in argument order
    - if by cause and effect then time order
    - if by commenting on an existing structure then structurally
    - if by categorizing, order by importance
