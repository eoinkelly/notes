# Erlang

Erlang has two paradigms

1. Functional
2. Concurrent

Sources:

- http://learnyousomeerlang.com

- _Most_ functions in erlang are referentially transparent
    - There are some exceptions e.g.`today()`
    - Erlang sticks to functional programming principles until it is not
      practical to do so.
- uses the Actor model
    - each actor is a process in a virtual machine
    - an actor has an inbox
    - it waits for a message in the inbox, does something and sends a response
    - actors ignore messages they do not understand
- let it crash
    - don't check for errors everywhere, just crash if something goes wrong and
      let your supervisor handle it
- man pages
    - stored in `/usr/local/opt/erlang/lib/erlang/man`
    - `erl -man lists` or add that dir to MANPATH

```erlang
%% built-in line editor uses a subset of emacs ^A start of line, ^E end of line etc.
help(). %% show help
q(). %% quit
init:stop(). %% quit
^G then q %% quit
^G then h %% see list of options for managing jobs, remote shells, quitting
f(). %% clear all variables (only works in shell)
Foo = 12. %% bind variable name Foo to value 12
f(Foo). %% clear Foo binding (only works in shell)
```

- variables
    - names begin with uppercase
    - can only be assigned once
    - = will try to match its left and right operands
    - names begining with `_` or just `_` are never bound by erlang - they are
      ignored.
        - `_` is not just a naming convention!
        - \_ is always seen as unbound and can be used as a wildcard in pattern
          matching.
- atoms
    - names start with lowercase
    - contants whose name is their value
    - atoms are kept in a global atom table and never GCed
        - this means you can memory bloat or overflow the table
        - WARNING: never create atoms dynamically!
    - there are a small selection of atoms that are reserved words:
        1. after
        2. and
            - always evaluates both operands (cannot be used as short circuit)
        3. andalso
            - only evaluates RHS argument if LHS one evaluates to true
            - is the shortcut version of `and`
        4. begin
        5. band - binary and
        6. bnot - binary not
        7. bor - binary or
        8. bsl - binary shift left
        9. bsr - binary shift right
        10. bxor - binary xor
        11. case
        12. catch
        13. cond
        14. div
        15. end
        16. fun
        17. if
        18. let
        19. not
        20. of
        21. or
            - always evaluates both operands (cannot be used as short circuit)
        22. orelse
            - only evaluates RHS argument if LHS one evaluates to false
            - is the shortcut version of `or`
        23. query
        24. receive
        25. rem
        26. try
        27. when
        28. xor
    - bare words e.g. `foo`, `name` or 'enclosed in single quotes'
        - can have spaces and punctuation if enclosed in single quotes
    - bit like Symbols in ruby
    - true and false are just atoms - there is no "truthy" and "falsy" values
    ```erlang
    1 == true # nope, there is no "truthiness" in erlang
    0 == false # nope, there is not "falsiness" in erlang
    ```
- equality operators
    - `=:=` is `==` in other langs
    - `=/=` is `!=` in other langs
    - erlang has strict type checking for most operations but will let you
      _compare_ things of different types (for pragmatic reasons)
    - you can compare anything with anything in erlang!
    - the defined order is

    ```
    number < atom < reference < fun < port < pid < tuple < list < bit string
    ```

    ```erlang
    a =:= b # strict equality
    a =/= b # strict inequality

    # these operators will convert floats and integers
    a == b # equality with type coercion
    a /= b # inequality with type coercion

    5 =:= 5.0. # false
    5 == 5.0. # true

    a > b
    a < b
    a >= b
    # a <= b # WRONG!
    a =< b # notice that it is written "equal or less than" in erlang
    ```

### tuples

- tuples use curly braces
- a two tuple where the first element is an atom is called a "tagged tuple"
    - tagged tuples are a quick way to make a new type
    - erlang is compiled so tuples basically become a global table of ints at
      runtime

```
%% tagged tuples
Temp = {celsius, 23.45}.
OtherTemp = {kelvin, 444}.

X = 12.
Y = 44.
Point = {X, Y}.
{A, B} = Point.
A. %% 12
B. %% 44
{C, _}F
C. %%  12
```

### lists

- are hetrogenous
- erlang strings
    - are just lists - there is no "real string" in erlang
    - erlang will print a list of numbers as a string if the numbers are
      printable
    - uses ~ to denote _tokens_ in strings
    - tokens behave a bit like printf placeholders and special char escapes in
      other langs. `io:format("Value is ~p and title is ~s~n", [Value, Title]).`
        - ~s = replace with a string
        - ~n = replace with newline
        - ~p = replace with a pretty printed erlang value
    - erlang has no built-in string type for historical reasons
    - this is improving over time - the VM now supports unicode
- list operators
    - ++ concatenates lists
    - -- remove from LHS any element that is a member of RHS
        - if LHS has 33 twice and RHS has 33 then it will only remove 33 once
          from LHS
    - hd/1 returns the value which is head of list
    - tl/1 returns the tail of the list (itself a list)
    - | (cons operator)
        - used to build list by concatenating LHS value onto RHS list
        - used to split lists in pattern matching
        - `[1 | 2]` gives an "improper" list
            - can be used for pattern matching
            - cannot be provided to any built-in functions
            - a proper version of this list would be `[1 | [2 | []]]`
            - when you write `[2]` erlang automatically makes it "proper" for
              you

```erlang
%% strings are lists in erlang
X = [97,98,99].
"abc"

Y = [1, 44.5, foo, {a, b}, 4, 55].


A = [1,2,3,4].
B = [4,3,5].

A -- B.
[1,2]

C = [2,5,1].
[2,5,1]

A -- C.
[3,4]

AA = [1,1,2,2,3,3].
[1,1,2,2,3,3]

AA -- C.
[1,2,3,3]


%% These are equivalent
[a, b, c, d] %% erlang makes this "proper" for you
[a | [b | [c | [d | []]]]] %% manually making a "proper" list
```

#### List comprehensions

- A succinct way of turning 1+ Lists into a new List

`Pattern <- List` is a `Generation expression`

```
NewList = [Expression || Pattern1 <- List1, Pattern2 <- List2, ..., PatternN <- ListN, Condition1, Condition2, ... ConditionN]
```

- You can use pattern matching in the Pattern to filter the list (so a Generator
  expression does not have to be the exact same as its List)

```erlang
Weather = [{toronto, rain}, {montreal, storms}, {london, fog}, {paris, sun}, {boston, fog}, {vancouver, snow}].
FoggyPlaces = [X || {X, fog} <- Weather].
```

#### Aside: BIFs

- Built-in functions
- Functions provided by the VM that are written in same lang VM is implemented
  in itself for speed (today this is C but was prolog historically)
- Examples: length(List)

### Bit syntax

- erlang has good bit/byte manipulation for historical reasons
- erlang is not as fast at C/C++ for number crunching but is very convenient
- makes it easy to pack other data types into a binary representation
- you can pattern match on binaries
    - makes it easy to unpack binary data into other data types

- a binary is 1+ segments separated by commas delimited by `<<` and `>>`

    <<segment1, segment2, ... segmentN>>

A segment can be specified in 4 forms

```
1. Value
2. Value/TypeSpecifierList
3. Value:Size
4. Value:Size/TypeSpecifierList
```

where

- Value
    - the actual data to be packed/unpacked
    - can also be a variable reference
- Size
    - a multiplier for the no. of "units" in this value
    - see below for `Unit`
- TypeSpecifierList is a `-` separated list of 1+ of the following
    1. Type
        - integer|float|binary|bytes|bitstring|bits|utf8|utf16|utf32
        - `bytes` is an alias for `binary`
        - `bits` is an alias for `bitstring`
    1. Signedness
        - signed|unsigned
    1. Endianness
        - big|little|native
        - only matters when type is one of integer, utf16, utf32, or float
    1. Unit
        - the size of the segment in bits
        - `unit:X` where 1 <= X <= 256
        - Size \* Unit = the no. of bits the value will take up
        - unit is automatically set for
            - utf8
            - utf16
            - utf32
        - is usually used to ensure a particular byte alignment

The above "packing and unpacking specification" provides a DSL for converting
other data types to/from a binary represtation

```erlang
Red = 16#FF0000. %% hex literal
RedPixel = <<Red:24>>. %%  <<255,0,0>>
RawPixels = <<213,45,132,64,76,32,76,0,0,234,32,15>>.

<<Pix1:24, Pix2:24, Pix3:24, Pix4:24>> = RawPixels.
Pix1. %%  13970820

<<R:8, G:8, B:8>> = <<Pix1:24>>.
R. %%  213
G. %%  45
B. %%  132
Pix1. %%  13970820
<<Pix1:24>>. %%  <<213,45,132>>

%% notice we can do pattern matching
<<R2:8, Rest/binary>> = RawPixels.
R2. %%  213
Rest. %%  <<45,132,64,76,32,76,0,0,234,32,15>>
```

Bit strings

    <<"i am a bitstring, a bit like a C array">>

- ++ more space efficient compared with "list strings"
- -- harder to manipulate
- -- don't use them to tag tuples, atoms are more efficent for that.

Binary comprehensions

- erlang has binary comprehensions that work like list comprehensions
- slightly different syntax but same purpose: to turn binaries into other types
  and vice versa

```erlang
[ X || <<X>> <= <<1,2,3,4,5>>, X rem 2 == 0]. %% [2,4]

16> Pixels = <<213,45,132,64,76,32,76,0,0,234,32,15>>.
<<213,45,132,64,76,32,76,0,0,234,32,15>>
17> RGB = [ {R,G,B} || <<R:8,G:8,B:8>> <= Pixels ].
[{213,45,132},{64,76,32},{76,0,0},{234,32,15}]
18> RGB.
[{213,45,132},{64,76,32},{76,0,0},{234,32,15}]
19> NewPixels = << <<R:8, G:8, B:8>> ||  {R,G,B} <- RGB >>.
<<213,45,132,64,76,32,76,0,0,234,32,15>>
20> Pixels == NewPixels
20> .
true
21> Pixels == NewPixels.
true
```

#### Aside: how to clear the erlang shell:

https://gist.github.com/hamidreza-s/10520105

```erlang
%% move cursor to beginning of the line
io:format("\e[H").

%% clear the console
io:format("\e[J").

%% both
io:format("\e[H\e[J").
```

## Modules

- a module is a collection of functions grouped in single file under a single
  name
- the `erlang` module
    - contains many common functions:
        - `hd/1` `length/1`
        - length/1 boolean opertaors
    - _most_ of its functions are always automatically imported in erlang
    - access the explicitly via `erlang:length([3,4])`
- function access syntax is `module_name:func_name(args...)`
- Modules have _attributes_ at the start of the file
- Attributes setup metadata about the module
- Module name is the only required piece of that metadata
    - module name is an atom (hence is always lowercase)

Module Attributes

- -module(modname).
    - takes a atom representing module name
    - filename should be `modname.erl`
- -export([func/arity, func/arity, ... ]).
    - takes a list
    - list is of function/arity
    - ??? what type is that ???
- -behaviour( ???
- -import(module, [func/arity, func/arity ...]).
    - is just a shortcut for writing code
    - many erlang devs believe using import hurts readability
- -define(MACRO, expression).
    - Erlang macros are pretty close to C #define
    - simple expresstions that will be text replaced by compiler before
      compilation
    - useful for constants etc.
    - used as `?MACRO` inside the file
    - macros are module attributes so are presumably? scoped to a single file
- -compile([flag1, flag2, ... flagN]).
    - an alternative to defining compiler flags on command line or in shell
- -vsn('some unique vsn probably a terrible idea').
    - specify the unique fingerprint used in hot code loading
    - not sure about uses for this

```erlang
%% The form is: -AttributeName(AttributeValue)

%% module name is an atom
-module(eoinsmodule).
```

There seems to be a pattern of modules exporting some helper functions that
explain what they are about e.g. `hipe:help().`

## Module introspection

Modules automatically define `module_info/0` and `module_info/1` which dump the
metadata about the module e.g.

```erlang
adder:module_info().

[{module,adder},
 {exports,[{add,2},
           {hello,0},
           {greet_and_add_magic,1},
           {module_info,0},
           {module_info,1}]},
 {attributes,[{vsn,[162663618642573659805142038623569107523]}]},
 {compile,[{options,[native]},
           {version,"6.0.1"},
           {time,{2015,10,28,18,17,57}},
           {source,"/Users/eoinkelly/Dropbox/Eoin/Notes/on-github/erlang/adder.erl"}]},
 {native,true},
 {md5,<<79,213,217,205,26,221,80,140,114,89,102,195,227,76,24,46>>}]

%% can also filter by the first atom in each tuple
adder:module_info(exports).
```

You can also use this in elixir

```elixir
List.module_info()
List.module_info(exports)
```

#### VSN

- An automatically generated unique fingerprint for each version your code
  (excluding comments)
- used in hot code loading
- you can specify it as a module attribute

### Functions

- Function clause
    - general form is
    ```
    name(args) -> body
    ```
- Function declaration
    - A function declaration is a ; separeated collection of function clauses
      that ends with a .
    - counts as one statement so ends in `.`

```erlang
-module(greeter).
-export([greet/2]).

greet(irish, Name) ->
  io:format("Cead mile failte ~s~n", [Name]);
greet(kiwi, Name) ->
  io:format("Kia ora ~s~n", [Name]);
greet(_, Name) ->
  io:format("Hello there ~s~n", [Name]).
```

- function name must be an atom
- function body is one or more erlang expressions separated by commas
- erlang has no return keyword, it uses implicit returns
- last expression in the function ends in .
- erlang functions _always_ return a value (like ruby)

Aside: function clauses vs a big case statement in othe langs

If function clauses are good then why don't I wrap the contents of my ruby
methods ina big case statement?

- in ruby we would have to bind all possible parameters. Function clause mean
  only the params you care about are bound - this makes the function bodies
  simpler.
- You can check on type of args in both cases
- the syntax is nicer in erlang/haskell etc.
- erlang pattern matching means that a lot of breaking down of args can happen
  in the function signature - ruby would have to do that manually

Pattern matching

- erlang function signature pattern matching is advanced
- Can bind variables in it

```erlang
valid_date_2(Date = {Y, M, D}, Time = {H, Min, S}) ->
  %% stuff
```

Guards

- pattern matching can
    - specify a particular number of args
    - break down compound types (tuples, lists) into their scalar parts
    - filter compound types (tuples, lists)
- pattern matching cannot
    - say anything about the value of a particular type

Guard expression

- is added to the fuction clause signature
- must retrun true for erlang to consider this clause a match for the args it
  has
- guard fails if it returns false or throws exception
- functions you can use in guards
    - there is a subset of built-in functions you can use
        - comparison and boolean evaluation
        - type checking
        - math operations
    - guards cannot accept user defined functions because guards need to be pure
      functions - erlang has no way to verify that your guard function would be
      pure so it disallows it.
- guards can be separeated by , or ;
    - `,` acts like `andalso` except
        - `andalso` can be nested in a guard but `,` cannot
        - `OP1 orelse OP2` will always fail if OP1 throws an exception
    - `;` acts like `orelse`
        - `orelse` can be nested in a guard but `;` cannot
        - `OP1 ; OP2` will not fail if OP1 throws an exception but OP2 passes

```
name(arg, arg ... arg) when guard sep guard sep ... sep guard ->
where sep is , or ;
```

### if

erlang if statements

- should probably be named something else because they don't function like other
  lang ifs
- return a value
- behaves a lot like a guard clause
    - `;` and `,` work the same as in guard clause
- have many "branches"
- sometimes have a "true branch" aka else statement
    - erlang programmers are encouraged not to use "true branches" but rather to
      cover all the logical possibilities with other if statements because it
      makes code easier to read.

```erlang
basic_if(A, B) ->
  %% note the ; at end of each branch except the last
  RetVal = if A =:= B -> io:format("are equal~n");
              A > B -> io:format("first is bigger~n");
              true -> io:format("fell into true branch~n")
           end,
  %% A contrived example to show that if expressions return a value
  {all_well, RetVal}.

other_if(A, B) ->
  %% a contrived and broken example to show usage of , and ; in else clause
  if A =:= B, A > 5; B < 20 -> io:format("are big and equal~n");
     true -> io:format("NOT big and equal~n")
  end.
```

### case of

- a `case...of` expression is basically the same as a bunch of function heads
  with guards.
    - each branch of the case statment could be converted into a function head
    - the right one to use depends on context
    - sometimes a case statement is a good alternative to having a function
      destructure some args and then call a multi-head private function which
      destructures w. guards
- can take a variable and run pattern matching on it and then run guards as well

```erlang
case THING of
  DESTRUCTURED_THING when GUARDS -> do_thing;
  TEST_RESULT_2 -> do_thing;
  TEST_RESULT_3 -> do_thing;
end
```

When to use case...of, multiple function heads

- both work in a very similar way
- both are represented in a very similar way in BEAM level so both have very
  similar performance characteristics
- it is not super well defined when to use each

Why use if when case...of is can do the job?

if was added to the language as a shorthand when you want guards but don't need
pattern matching

## Compiling

BEAM = Bogdan/Björn's Erlang Abstract Machine

1. via erlang shell
2. via `erlc` command

Code can be compiled to be

1. a cross-platform BEAM file
2. a "native" beam file via HiPE (High Performance Erlang) project
    - contains some native and cross-platform parts
    - runs faster
    - not available on all platforms (seems ok on OSX)
    - `hipe:help().` for info

common compile flags

- debug_info
    - add debug info
- export_all
    - export all functions
- {d, Macro}
    - define Macro as true
- {d, Macro, Value}
    - define Macro as Value
- {outdir, Dir}
    - tell compiler not to compile into current dir

```erlang
%% in erlang shell

cd("/path/to/erlang/files").
c(things).
c(things.erl). %% also works
things:somefunc().
things:otherfunc().

%% You can pass compiler flags
c(things, [debug_info, export_all]).


%% generate native beam with hipe
hipe:c(things).

% use hipe compiler by passing the native atom to c/2
c(things, [native]).
```

### Types

- atom
- list
- binary
- term
- float
- tuple
- integer
- iolist
- pid
- port
- ref

Erlang is strongly typed => no automatic type coercion. You can do explicit type
conversions via a family of `<type>_to_<type>/1` functions e.g.
`erlang:atom_to_binary/1`

There are a bunch of `is_<type>/1` functions you can use to check type in guards

Erlang does _not_ have the equivalent of `foo.class` in ruby i.e. there is no
way to introspect the type of a value. The stated reasoning for this is that
erlang is about programming for the happy path and "let it crash". Erlang has no
null/nil value

## Error handling

Types of error

1. compile-time error
    - errors that can be found by the compiler
1. logical error
    - hardest to debug
    - they don't cause your program to crash
    - it just does not do what it is supposed to
    - testing is your only friend here
1. run-time error
    - exceptions
1. generated error

There are three kinds of exception in Erlang

1. errors
    - are a way for a function to stop its execution if it has no way to
      reliably continue
    ```erlang
    erlang:error(no_api_available).
    ```

    - reason
        - is an atom
        - can be any name
        - erlang has some built-in reason names (they will include a message
          when displayed)
            - badarith
            - badarg
            - undef
            - badfun
            - badmatch
            - if_clause
            - case_clause
            - function_clause
        - you will probably never generate an error with a built-in reason
1. exits
    - two kinds
        1. internal
            - triggered by `exit/1`
            - makes current process stop execution
        1. external
            - triggered by `exit/2`
    - they have very similar use cases to errors
    - they do not return a stack trace
    - used when it would be impractical or unnecessary to send a stacktrace to
      all listening processes
1. throws
    - does not crash the process - just changes control flow
    - provides a sort of non-local return or goto
    - used for error situations that the process can handle
    - `throw(any_atom_describing_reason).`
    - good idea to limit usage of throw to a single module - otherwise debugging
      gets very hard

## Processes

Erlang process is a function with some hidden state (mailbox)

- each process has a `pid` which is used to communicate with it

You can see whether the VM is in SMP mode or not from the status line

```
Erlang/OTP 18 [erts-7.1] [source] [64-bit] [smp:4:4] [async-threads:10] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false] [dtrace]
```

```
[smp:X:Y]
X = number of cores available
Y = number of schedulers

[rq:Z]
Z = number of run queues available
```

- `self/0` returns the pid of the current process (handy to use in shell)
- process mailbox
    - keeps messages in the order received
    - a message is taken out of the mailbox when it is read
    - use `flush/0` to inspect the contents of the current processes mailbox

Send messages to processes using `!`

```erlang
%% send <message> to a process mailbox (represented by pid)
<pid> ! <message>.

%% send <message> to multiple pids mailboxes
<pid1> ! <pid2> ! <pid3> ! <message>.
```

- receive blocks
- syntastically similar to `case ... of`

```erlang
receive
    Pattern1 when Guard1 ->
        Expression1;
    Pattern2 when Guard2 ->
        Expression2;
    Pattern3 when Guard3 ->
        Expression3;
    Pattern4 ->
        Expression4
end.
```

Aside: inspecting process state

sys:get_status(SomePid). %% only works if Pid is an OTP app

SASL is the error reporting daemon in OTP - `rb` is the module used to collect
the reports.

`proc_lib` can be used to make a short-lived process OTP compatible

tracing is intended for debugging only, not for use in production

Process links

- `link(Pid)`
- `unlink(Pid)`
- links cannot be stacked - no matter how many times you call link/1 with a
  given Pid only one link will be created between the processes
- link two processes together so that
- if one crashes (from a throw, error, exit) then the other dies too due to a
  special message it receives from the crashing process
- this special message is not sent if the process (function) exits cleanly
- are bi-directional
- use spawn_link/1-3 to spawn a process and link it atomically
    - prevents errors from of your process dies before it is linked
    - (safer than doing it as separate steps)

Exit signals are an example of "special" kind of message called "signal"

- system process
    - like a normal process but can convert a signal into a normal message

```
process_flag(trap_exit, true).
```

### Registered names for processes

If you have a process with a supervisor that is able to restart the process if
it dies then you can't rely on the pid always being the same. Erlang solves this
by allowing you to register a name for a process

```erlang
regsiter(Pid, some_name).

registered(). %% see all registered processes

CurrentPid = whereis(some_name).
```

- the registered name is shared global state
    - many processes can modify it at same time
    - can be a source of race conditions
- only use named processes for
    - services unique to an instance of the VM
    - processes that will run for the whole lifetime of your app
