# API design

Github API is seen as a good one.

Docs: https://developer.github.com/v3/

Things it does:

- version is not in the URL - it is sent as a header

    ```
    X-GitHub-Media-Type: github.v3
    ```

    You request a version of the api using the Accept header:

    ```
    Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json
    ```

- very explorable, they seem to have embraced hypermedia apis
- blank fields are included as null not ommited
- all times are in ISO 8601 timestamp format.
    - they also allow setting timezone with the `Time-Zone` header
- error objects contain a `documentation_url` property that links to their docs
- when there are urls that need parameters added they demo them in the URL
  wrapped in `{}` e.g.
    ```
    members_url: "https://api.github.com/orgs/GritLearning/members{/member}",
    ```
- properties ending in `*_url` are in RFC 6570 URL Template format so you can
  use a URL templating library to work iwth them

# JSON API

Heroku has a good post on API design
https://github.com/interagent/http-api-design TODO: contrast the heroku post
with what JSON API does

- A JSON object is the root of _every_ JSON API response
- Response is either "primary data" or "array of error objects"

Data document structure optional encased in []

- (object)
    - data (object, array, scalar)
    - meta [object]
        - non standard info about the primary data i.e. anything that cannot be
          represented as an attribute or relationship
    - links [object]
        - URLs related to the primary data
    - included [object]
        - a list of resrouce objects related to the primary one and included in
          this response

- Primary data must be under "data" key

Error document structure

- (object)
    - errors (array)

- server
    - rails
        - json-api::Resources is aiming to be fully compliant and is under heavy
          dev to get there
        - activemodel::serializers is not currently as compliant as
          JSONAPI::Resources but might get there too
- js
    - ember-data
        - currently ember-data is not 100% compatibile but they are aiming to be
          once JSON API hits 1.0
            - https://github.com/emberjs/data/issues/1988
    - ember-json-api
        - an adaptor for ember-data to make it JSON API compliant
            - unclear what its future will be
