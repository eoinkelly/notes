# Rails security checklist

## Updated & patched dependencies

- Rails and all gems patched and up to date?
    - how to do this for gems that are not part of rails???

## params

- Have a look at all uses for params[] in the codebase: Is everything coming
  from `params` being filtered before being used?
    - any interpolated strings?
    - anywhere it is being used directly e.g. as args to `redirect_to` Are all
      methods in controller that are not actions made private? Does file upload
      limited to just the filetypes that are not executable?
- Is any sensitive info appearing in the logs?
- CSRF protection present and correct?
- has strong params/mass assignment been set appropriately on all models?
- are all controller actions that change the DB auth checked?
- Is user content always escaped before it is rendered?
- What data is being stored in the Session? - would it be bad if an attacker
  could see any of it?

## session

- session[] is (by default) stored totally in the cookie so is passed over the
  network in the clear
- have a look at all uses of session[] in the codebase
    - any unfiltered params going in there?
    - any sensitive info going in there?
- call reset_session after a successful logout ???
- is `config.secret_key_base` appropriately random?

## Passwords

- How are passwords stored in the database?
- Are password policies being enforced?
    - password strength?
    - num failed logins?
    - password expiry/reset?

## SSL

- Is it enabled? Should it be?
