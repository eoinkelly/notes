### Rails Controllers Part II video

#### Questions for student

- Are there any security concerns with the way you have written your
  controllers?
- Consider your controller code through the lens of security.
    - Are there any potential problems?
    - What potentially risky jobs do controllers (in general, not just yours)
      have?
    - What can we do to mitigate these problems?
- He abstracts out the `find_deck` method in the `CardsController`.
    - What are the benefits of doing this?
    - What are the disadvantages of doing this?
    - Given the benefits and disadavantages you have come up with, would you
      abstract it?
    - Tutor note: what i'm trying to get at here is the trade off between
      creating an abstraction and removing duplication
- You will notice that we are assigning a few `@instance_variables in our
  controller now (for magic copying to the view) - if assiging 2 is ok, what do
  you think of a controller that assings 100? Where would you draw the line?
    - Bonus: what strategies could we use to avoid having so many instance
      variables?
- in `Cards#new` he creates a new card object via `@deck.cards.new`. Is this the
  exact same object we get when the user submits the form to the `#create`
  method?
    - Hint: Remember `#object_id` on an object to check its unique ID.
- view partials
    - partials are good when you have a chunk of template that you want to use
      in multiple places (removes duplication)
        - when would you _not_ use a partial if you see some view template that
          is the same?
    - Are partials good at making a complex template simpler (even if there is
      no duplication)?
        - Tutor: trying to show the diff between creating abstrction and just
          moving code around
    - Notice how he has explicitly passed in variables into the partial - this
      is more typing for you but what is the advantage of this?
        - Do you have to explicitly pass in variables to a partial (hint: try it
          out)?
        - What are the advantages of each approach?
- What is the difference between `resources` and `resource` in the routes file.
  What is the heuristic for knowing which one to use? ANSWER: In routes file,
  resources is for things that have an id - if it doesn't have an id you should
  use resource
- He returns current_user from `signed_in?` method - I don't think this is
  correct - I think you should explicitly return a boolean.

#### Notes

He uses a pattern of passing the form builder into the partial, not having the
whole thing be in a partial - this is quite nice.

- if you pass #render an object, it will look for a partial with the same name
  e.g. render wombat # loads "\_wombat.html.haml"
    - not sure how useful this is?

- he is very against adding extra actions to controllers (outside of the 7) e.g.
  rather than adding #sign_in to UsersController he suggests
  SessionsController#create i guess this is more restful

- form_for can take a symbol which does ???

```ruby
form_for(:session) do |form|
  ...
```

he recommends putting the helper_method call right after the method defn.
because you only have one place to look - i think this is quite nice.

- research & doc what `helper_method` does in controllers
    - it makes the method you give it available to the views as a helper
    - ??? if you don't put it in the ApplicationController, do you get per view
      helpers from it?

- is he correct in saying that cookie.sign will also encrypt the cookie ???

In routes file, resources is for things that have an id - if it doesn't have an
id you should use resource
