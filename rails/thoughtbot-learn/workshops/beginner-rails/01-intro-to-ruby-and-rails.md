## Intro to ruby and rails

### Ruby basics video

my review:

- very basic, string concatenation, looping

#### Questions

```
irb(main):005:0> "hello" + 11
TypeError: no implicit conversion of Fixnum into String
```

- Why does this fail?
- What "implicit conversions" does ruby do?
- What does the `.` operator in ruby do?
