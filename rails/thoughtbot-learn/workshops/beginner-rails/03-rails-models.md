### Rails Models video

my review: _ decent basic intro to rails _ Interesting: he starts with a
migration for his model before he makes any model

Questions for rose

- Show me your repo of code you wrote for this video
- Tell me about the MVC pattern in your own words. What are the jobs of each
  part?
- Does all business logic have to go in the models? Where else might it go?
- Tell me about helpers - what are they?
    - Why do rails generators create a new file there for each controller?
- What is the "one sentence" overview of how bundler works?
- Migrations:
    - can you think of any limitations of migrations? Are there cases you should
      not use them?
    - Are migrations good for changing the structure of database
    - Are they good for adding content to the database?
    - Where is the resource that shows you exactly what column types rails will
      create
- why would we want a primary key on a database table?

- What are the differences between running IRB in your app directory and rails
  console?
- What is mass assignment protection?
    - ME: how is this different in Rails4 with strong params?
- what does `protect_from_forgery` do?
- what is the difference between methods and actions in a controller?
- How many routes did we end up creating in these videos? (Hint: they are very
  common)
- What is the difference between a `Hash` object and
  `HashWithIndifferentAccess`?
- It's not mentioned in the video but what does the SOLID acronym stand for in
  Object Oriented design?

NEW TO ME:

- I didn't know that #view_assigns was the thing that took instance variables in
  the controller and passed them to the view so it could create instance
  variables from them.
- you can test routes in console using `app.route_helper_name(any params)`
- Rails4 uses `patch` for updates not `put`
- What is diff between `update_attributes` and `update` ???
- rails maps HTTP verb DELETE to #destroy for historical reasons - we need to
  stick with it
- TODO: become "performance fit" with strong parameters.
