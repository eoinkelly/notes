# Intermediate Rails Pt 2.

## Questions for rose

- When should you use single table inheritance - what is his sentence for
  remembering when to do it?
- What is polymorphism?
- Notice again how he goes about making the app - he works from the routes
  inwards, letting the error message be his guide.
- when he restarts his rails server he passes the `-d` parameter. What does this
  do?
- "write what you want and then figure out how to make it work" - work your way
  in from the outside. There are two classes in ruby that are really handy for
  quickly making new objects - they are Struct and `OpenStruct` - what is the
  difference between these? What are their strengths and weaknesses?
- Show me some example code you have written that demonstrates the difference
  between Struct and OpenStruct

## Notes

He really wants you to stick to the 7 resourceful actions in controllers Think
of what you want to happen in terms of I am getting|putting|deleting|creating
NOUNNAME and choose NOUNNAME appropriately

```
# will render _foo.html.haml once for each element of @foos
render @foos
```

```
# bad example of using STI
class Shout < ActiveRecord::Base
    # shout data
    # shout behaviour
end

class TextShout < Shout
    # TextShout data (different to Shout data)
end

class ImageShout < Shout
    # ImageShout data (different to Shout data)
end
```

- He believes STI works best with "models that will have the exact same data but
  different behaviour"
    - if the data is different we don't want to use STI
- If your models have different data then there will be a lot of NULL columns in
  the table
    - why is this bad?

```ruby
class Owner
end

class Pet < ActiveRecord::Base
end

class Fish < Pet
    # unique fishy behaviour
end
class Cat < Pet
    # unique catty behaviour
end

# table would look like
# id name owner_id created_at
```

he thinks about his data models as db columns first

```ruby
# if shout.content is a polymorphic relationship, render will render the partial
# name based on the type - this is a pretty neat pattern!
render shout.content
```

Your helper modules are mixed into the view class.

If I am the teacher, the the _reflexive association_ is that you are the
student.
