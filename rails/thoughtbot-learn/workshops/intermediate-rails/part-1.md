# Intermediate rails part 1

# Questions for rose

- he begins by deciding some data models here wants
- what are the common group names in the Gemfile?
- what is the advantage of making groups in your Gemfile? ANSWER: you can manage
  groups separately, can exclude certain groups, rails does this too!
- Rails scaffolds are great. Any reason you should not use them? A: don't leave
  empty/placeholder files in your repo understand everything the generator
  makes! Magic is only good if you know what is going on! :-)
- What are the pros/cons of specifying versions in your Gemfile?

- Discuss: Notice how he builds out the app, starting at the route -> controller
  -> model, getting errors all along the way and letting the errors guide him.
  Compare this with starting from the models and working your way out. What are
  the trade-offs? (rembember: trade off implies that there are both pros and
  cons)
    - notice that he does this a few times - he starts with a plain english
      description of what the users should be able to do and works his way
      backwards.
    - what popular/recently controversial coding practice does this resemble?
- Todo: make a new migration manually (without using a generator) that does
  exactly the same as the rails generator. Do the same for the model generator
- When you change initializers you have to restart your server because
  initializers are only checked at server startup.
    - How does rails know when you other files have changed?
    - Isn't this a terrible idea for an app in production? How does rails solve
      this?
- Why would you want to keep the number of public methods in your class low?
- What is the difference between `resource` and `resources` in the routes file?
- Why does he recommend only adding the routes you are currently using (using
  except ...) - wouldn't it be easier to just create all the routes especially
  since it is easier for you/less typing?

- He uses the `kill` command to stop the rails server - what does the `-INT`
  parameter to kill do?
- Do you think the rails `div_for` is a good idea? What are the pros/cons?
- What is polymorphism?

## Notes

investigate the monban gem - compare to devise

```ruby
root to: 'home#show', via: :get # a nice little limitation to GET
```

read up on `rexource` vs `resources`

"if the object you are talking about doesn't have an id then it is a singular
resource so you should use `resource` not `resources` in the routes

resource creates 6 routes not 7 - it does not make #index Idea: a script that
will figure out which routes are defined in routes.rb that don't exist as
controller actions

default_scope in rails 4 will require a block research what default_scope does
