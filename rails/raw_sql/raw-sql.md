# What is the safest way to write raw SQL in a Rails app?

This document assumes PostgreSQL.

## Conclusion

Overview of the various methods of sending Raw SQL in ActiveRecord:

* ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute
    * Always does Simple-Query at Postgres protocol level
    * -- You must use `PREPARE...EXECUTE` in your SQL string to get separation or just rely on escaping
    * -- Some manual memory management of the PG::Result seems to be required
* ActiveRecord::Base.connection.select_all
    * Does Parse/Bind/Describe/Execute/Sync at the Postgres protocol level
    * ++ You can pass bound parameters
    * -- It is extremely fiddly and poorly documented to pass bound parameters
* ActiveRecord::Base.connection.exec_query
    * Does Parse/Bind/Describe/Execute/Sync at the Postgres protocol level
    * ++ You can pass bound parameters
    * -- It is extremely fiddly and poorly documented to pass bound parameters
* ActiveRecord::Base.connection.raw_connection.exec_params
    * Drops down to the PG::Connection
    * ++ You can pass bound parameters
    * ++ Passing bound parameters is fairly straight forward
    * -- Some manual memory management of the PG::Result seems to be required


Avoid writing raw SQL if you can but your options from most safe to least safe for writing raw SQL:

1. Use a method which sends the SQL and the parameters are separate messages to the DB so that the DB can **always** tell which is which.
    * -- you have to manage type conversions yourself
    * ++ you don't need to worry about escaping
    * == you should still probably do some basic santization to prevent things like XSS from values stored in your DB
1. Use ActiveRecord to interpolate values into the SQL string for you and then send it to the DB
    * This is the documented approach in the Rails guides
1. Use ActiveRecord to interpolate values into the SQL string for you and then separately send it to the DB
    ```ruby
    # you must pass an array, it will not sponge positional args up
    ActiveRecord::Base.sanitize_sql_array( ["name = ? AND blah = ?", a, b])
    ```
1. Interpolate values into a string of SQL, taking care of all the escaping and santizing yourself (least safe)

## Questions

Q: the docs are ambibious about whether we need to call PG::Result#clear every time - find out the deal here


## Syntax confusion about `?`

ActiveRecord can interpolate values into a SQL string for you via

1. Placeholder maker `?` which causes AR to match up its usage to the position of an arg within an array
1. Named placeolder e.g. `:foo` which is used as the key in a hash to get the value to replace

The `?` syntax **looks like MySQL bound parameters** but using it does not mean that the query will use bound parameters when sent to the DB.

It does mean that you are telling AR to do escaping for you on the value which is probably safer than doing it yourself or (worst case) just interpolating it into the string yourself.

## Public ActiveRecord methods for running raw SQL

1. `SomeModel.find_by_sql`
    * returns an actual `Array` of `SomeModel` objects (not an `ActiveRecord::Relation`)
    * examples:
        ```ruby
        Page.find_by_sql("select * from pages where id = 3") # => Array<Page>

        # These also work (note that the ? and :foo are replaced by AR not
        # Postgres. All the `?` and `:foo` values are interpolated into the string
        # before it is sent to Postgres. The examples below send exactly the same SQL to Postgres
        Page.find_by_sql(["select * from pages where id = ?", 3])
        Page.find_by_sql(["select * from pages where id = :some_id", {some_id: 3}])
        ```
    * Caveat: Not really suitable for doing INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
    * Does Parse/Bind/Describe/Execute/Sync at the Postgres protocol level
        * This is true even if you give it a single string of SQL with no interpolations
    * You can send bound parameters but it has the same ergonomic problems as `ActiveRecord::Base.connection.exec_query`
1. `ActiveRecord::Base.connection.select_all`
    * `ActiveRecord::Base.connection.select_all(arel, name = nil, binds = [], preparable: nil)`
    * Note: lives on the connection adapter, not the model but can get at the instance of the connection adapter class via **any** model
            * e.g. `ActiveRecord::Base.connection == User.connection == Page.connection`
    * Returns an instance of `ActiveRecord::Result` which can be converted to an array of hashes
    * Just runs a SQL query and gives back data - it does not create ActiveRecord objects from that data. This makes it very useful for building reports if we don't need to do "Active Model" things with the returned data.
    * Does Parse/Bind/Describe/Execute/Sync at the Postgres protocol level
    * You can send bound parameters but it has the same ergonomic problems as `ActiveRecord::Base.connection.exec_query`
1. `ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute(sql, name = nil)`
    * Executes an SQL statement, returning a PG::Result object on success or raising a PG::Error exception otherwise. Note: the PG::Result object is manually memory managed; if you don't need it specifically, you may want consider the exec_query wrapper
    * Does _Simple Query_ at Postgres protocol level
    * example:
        ```ruby
        sql = "SELECT ..."
        pg_result = ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute(sql)
        results = pg_result.values
        pg_result.clear

        results
        ```
    * You can do a SQL level `PREPARE...EXECUTE` to get more safety with this method:
        ```ruby
        def do_safe_exec(sql_query, params)
          sql_query = "#{sql_query};" unless sql_query.ends_with?(";")

          stmt_name = "a#{Time.now.to_i}"
          unrolled_params = params.map { |param| "'#{param}'" }.join(",")

          prepared_sql = <<~EO_SQL
              PREPARE #{stmt_name} AS #{sql_query}
              EXECUTE #{stmt_name}(#{unrolled_params});
          EO_SQL

          pg_result = ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute(prepared_sql)

          ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute("DEALLOCATE #{stmt_name};")

          results = pg_result.to_a

          # Clear the memory associated with the PG::Result
          pg_result.clear

          results
        end
        ```
    * A caveat to using execute is depending on your database connector, the result returned by this method might require manual garbage collection. Consider using exec_query instead.
        * TODO: docs mention this but I can't find examples of doing the cleanup

## Private ActiveRecord methods for running raw SQL

1. `ActiveRecord::Base.connection.exec_query(sql, name = "SQL", binds = [], prepare: false)`
    * Technically this is private API
    * Executes sql statement in the context of this connection using binds as the bind substitutes. name is logged along with the executed sql statement.
    * Uses Postgres Parse/Bind/Describe/Execute/Sync protocol messages under the hood
    * Returns an instance of `ActiveRecord::Result` which can be converted to an array of hashes
        * ActiveRecords::Result object which has handy methods like .columns and .rows to access headers and values.
    * Caveat: creating the bind parameters is really fiddly and uses a bunch of undocumented AR objects
    * example:
        ```ruby
        # works
        full_sql = "select * from pages where template = 'topics'"
        ActiveRecord::Base.connection.exec_query(full_sql)

        # works
        sql = "select * from pages where template = $1"
        binds = [ActiveRecord::Relation::QueryAttribute.new("something", param_values.first, ActiveRecord::Type::String.new)]
        ActiveRecord::Base.connection.exec_query(sql, 'blah', binds)
        # => ActiveRecord::Result
        ```
    * Conclusion: AR doesn't really support us using exec_query very well
1. `ActiveRecord::Base.connection.raw_connection.exec_params`
    * Drops down to the underlying `PG::Connection` object
    * Seems to work well for executing raw SQL in the safest manner possible


## Aside: %q and %Q refresher

* Use %q or %Q to simplify quoting in long strings which contain single and double quotes e.g. SQL
* %q = create a string using "single quote rules" but you can choose your own
delimiter
* %Q = create a string using "double quote rules" but you choose your own
delimiter i.e. use %Q if you need variable interpolation
* examples
    ```
    [22] pry(main)> x = 34
    34

    [23] pry(main)> %q[this is literally #{x}!]
    "this is literally \#{x}!"

    [24] pry(main)> %Q[this is literally #{x}!]
    "this is literally 34!"
    ```
