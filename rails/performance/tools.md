Appliation performance monitoring solutions for Rails apps:

1. New Relic
    - samples a % of requests - it does not run on every request
    - agent takes up non-trivial amount of RAM (30-50 MB range)
1. Skylight
    - does not sample a % of requests, every request is profiled
    - focuses on the 95th percentile
    - asserts that web perf graphs are typically log-normal not normal
    - much smaller agent

## T-test

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test
- William Seally Gosset published under pseudonym _Student_, hence the name
