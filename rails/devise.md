# Devise Token authenticatable

This token can be given via

1. a query string or
2. HTTP Basic Authentication.

Strategy for signing in a user, based on a authenticatable token. This works for
both params and http. For the former, all you need to do is to pass the params
in the URL:

http://myapp.example.com/?user_token=SECRET

For headers, you can use basic authentication passing the token as username and
blank password. Since some clients may require a password, you can pass “X” as
password and it will simply be ignored.

## Flow

```
when the user hits any rails app endpoint it gets back an `_appname_session` via Set-Cookie
the browser sends that cookie back with every request


so waht does devise/warden do

GET /users/sign_in
server returns HTML Form with an embedded CSRF field
POST /users
server verifies the username & password
returns reply with a Cookie representing the session that has been created on the server
```

## Rails session cookies vs JWT (in the context of a rails app)

- Rails session cookie
    - ++ work out of the box
- JWT tokens
    - ++ less vulnerable to CSRF attacks because you have to explicitly add the
      Authorization header with the token (rather than the browser automatically
      attaching the Cookie to every request)
        - this is probably more convenient in a rails app?
    - ++ are easier to use if your client is not a web browser e.g. a native
      mobile app
        - QUESTION: How much easier? It seems like you are attaching a HTTP
          header in either case?
    - ++ are much easier if you auth against one domain and want to access
      resources on a different domain
        - this explains why things like Auth0 are fans of them - they are
          required for their business model :-)
    - ++ has a built-in expiration timestamp
        - you are relying on the browser to expire session cookies - JWT can let
          server control it
        - caveat: the server implementation has to actually check this (some
          don't)
