## ActiveRecord query interface #where

Higher level API than Arel

```
where(name: 'x')
# WHERE name = 'x'

where(name: nil)
# WHERE name IS NULL

where(name: ['x', 'y'])
# WHERE name IN ('x', 'y')

where(name: ['x', 'y', nil])
# (WHERE name IN ('x', 'y') OR name IS NULL)
```

- #where
    - is a DSL for making a SQL WHERE clause
    - can only combine queries using AND
    - it only provides the `=` (equal), `<>` (not equal) and `in` operators
    - cannot do numeric comparisons e.g. `<=`

- #where can receive as arg
    1. a hash
    2. an array
    3. a string
    4. an arel object

Usage of the AR query interface should be limited to models in the system!

SQL things Arel can do _ named functions _ Arel::Nodes::NamedFunction #new(name,
expr, aliaz = nil) _ order by _ all conditionals/comparisons \* Unions

The layers:

1. ActiveRecord Query DSL
2. Arel
3. Raw SQL

Arel is

- just a SQL generator library - it does not call the DB or retrieve data
- the engine that rails uses to turn method calls (ActiveRecord Query DSL) into
  SQL statements.
- Each column in Arel::Table is represented by Arel::Attributes::Attribute

How you work with Arel

1. Figure out what I want to do in raw SQL
2. As much as possible express it with the normal ActiveRecord query DSL.
   Express the rest as Arel
3. Get hold of a reference to Arel::Table
4. Get a reference to some Arel::Attributes::Attribute (columns) in it
5. send predicate messages to the Arel::Attributes::Attribute to start building
   the query
6. Start work on the query using ActiveRecord #where

Example

```
SELECT posts.*
  FROM posts
 WHERE posts.published_at > (now() - INTERVAL '1 year')
    OR posts.title LIKE '%updated';


Post.where(
  Post.arel_table[:published_at].gt(1.year.ago).
    or(Post.arel_table[:title].matches('%updated')))



# Use this method if you are not in ActiveRecord (you can use Arel with any DB connection)
authors = Arel::Table.new(:authors)
authors.where(authors[:name].eq('amy'))
# it seems #where is also part of Arel ???


# Either A or B
Author.where(city: 'Orlando').where('name = ? OR name = ?', 'Bob', 'Carol')

name =Author.arel_table[:name]
Author.where(city: 'Orlando').where(name.eq('Bob').or(name.eq('Carol')))


# One of a list SQL "IN"
Author.where(city: 'Orlando').where('name IN (?)', ['Bob', 'Carol']) # raw

name =Author.arel_table[:name]
Author.where(city: 'Orlando').where(name.in(['Bob', 'Carol'])) # arel
Author.where(city: 'Orlando').where(name: ['Bob', 'Carol']) # AR query interface (best)

# BETWEEN
Author.where('book_count BETWEEN ? AND ?, 1, 5)

book_count = Author.arel_table[:book_count]
Author.where(book_count.between(1..5))

Author.where(book_count: 1..5) # will call Arel #in under the covers (best way)
```

What SQL calls "SELECT clause" is called a "projection" in Arel

Arel is designed to let you make SQL without the problems associated with string
interpolation. It can be used (as Rails does) to build an ORM.

Conclusion: to make the most of Arel I first need to be good at SQL

Advantages of Arel over raw SQL:

1. It automatically scopes column names if you have a join e.g. `id` would be
   ambigious if you join two tables which have `id` columns
1. It lets you break SQL queries apart to be more readable
1. It is harder to arbitrarily combine sub queries that use string interpolation

Arel::Table _ acts like a hash that has each column of the table as a key _ each
column is of type Node

Arel has "predications". A predication is the logical affirmation of something
about another; especially : assignment of something to a class "i contend that
thing A is related to thing B by {predicate}"

Arel's predications are documented at
https://github.com/rails/arel/blob/master/lib/arel/predications.rb

When breaking apart a query to use Arel, I find a good rule of thumb is to break
out a method

1. anywhere the word AND or OR is used,
2. or when something is wrapped in parenthesis.

Arel is a Relational Algebra gem that allows you to generate SQL queries
directly from an abstract syntax tree (AST) of nodes. Itâ€™s what Active Record
uses internally to build up expressions symbolically from the Hash syntax.

QUESTION: What exacty is a relational algebra

The #where method in Active Record can accept an Arel node e.g.
`User.where({arel methods})`

```
User.arel_table

[3] pry(main)> pat = Page.arel_table
#<Arel::Table:0x007ffa5e8d8320 @name="pages", @engine=Page (call 'Page.connection' to establish a connection), @columns=nil, @aliases=[], @table_alias=nil, @primary_key=nil>

[8] pry(main)> pat.class.ancestors
[
    [0] Arel::Table < Object,
    [1] Arel::FactoryMethods,
    [2] Arel::Crud,
    [3] Object < BasicObject,
    [4] PP::ObjectMixin,
    [5] ActiveSupport::Dependencies::Loadable,
    [6] JSON::Ext::Generator::GeneratorMethods::Object,
    [7] Kernel,
    [8] Buff::Extensions::Kernel::Reporting,
    [9] BasicObject
]

# Basic usage

pat = Page.arel_table
query = pat.project(Arel.sql('*'))
query.to_sql
 "SELECT * FROM \"pages\""

[16] pry(main)> Page.where(pat[:header].eq('foo')).to_sql
"SELECT \"pages\".* FROM \"pages\"  WHERE \"pages\".\"header\" = 'foo'"
```

The ancestor list for Arel::Table is not too crazy

Arel provides a bunch of predicates:

- eq
- not_eq
- in
- not_in
- gteq
- gt
- lteq
- lt
- matches
- does_not_match

can append `*_all` or `*_any` to all the above

```ruby
# match any row where name is equal to 'value'
name.eq('value')

# eq_all does not make much sense I think - the *_all suffix makes more sense for predicates like `in`
# combines the predicates with AND
name.eq_all(['val1', 'val2', 'val3'])

# "match any row where name is one of these values
# combines predicates with OR
name.eq_any(['val1', 'val2', 'val3'])

[2] pry(main)> usert = User.arel_table
[6] pry(main)> name = usert[:name]

[7] pry(main)> usert.where(name.eq('joe')).to_sql
"SELECT FROM \"users\"  WHERE \"users\".\"name\" = 'joe'"

[9] pry(main)> usert.where(name.eq_all(['joe', 'bob', 'dog'])).to_sql
"SELECT FROM \"users\"  WHERE (\"users\".\"name\" = 'joe' AND \"users\".\"name\" = 'bob' AND \"users\".\"name\" = 'dog')"

[10] pry(main)> usert.where(name.eq_any(['joe', 'bob', 'dog'])).to_sql
"SELECT FROM \"users\"  WHERE (\"users\".\"name\" = 'joe' OR \"users\".\"name\" = 'bob' OR \"users\".\"name\" = 'dog')"


[14] pry(main)> usert.where(name.in_any([[1,2], [3,4]])).to_sql
"SELECT FROM \"users\"  WHERE (\"users\".\"name\" IN (1, 2) OR \"users\".\"name\" IN (3, 4))"

[15] pry(main)> usert.where(name.in_all([[1,2], [3,4]])).to_sql
"SELECT FROM \"users\"  WHERE (\"users\".\"name\" IN (1, 2) AND \"users\".\"name\" IN (3, 4))"
```

The Squeel library provides some sugar on top of Arel

```
Author.where { name ~= 'foo' }
```
