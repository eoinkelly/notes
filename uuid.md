# UUID

- Universally unique identifiers
- also known as _Globally unique identifier (GUID)_
- not _guaranteed_ to be unique, the probability of a duplicate is extremely
  low.
- for distributed systems, these identifiers provide a better uniqueness
  guarantee than sequence generators, which are only unique within a single
  database.
- Postgres has a UUID type
- things that provide uuid algorithms
    - on some `*BDS` systems `libc` provides UUID functions
    - on linux the `libuuid` lib provides UUID functions
    - ruby `SecureRandom` and `uuid` gem
    - postgres `owssp` extension
- The relevant standards
    - ITU-T Rec. X.667
    - ISO/IEC 9834-8:2005
    - RFC 4122

    specify four algorithms for generating UUIDs, identified by the version
    numbers 1, 3, 4, and 5. There is no version 2 algorithm. No single algorithm
    is suitable for all use-cases.

# Format

- usually stored in lowercase hex with dashes (the "standard form")
- but may appear without dashes or in upper/mixed case
- 32 hex digits (128 bits)

```
# example:
a0eebc99-9c0b-4ef8-bb6d-6bb9bd380a11

# has the format:
{8}-{4}-{4}-{4}-{12}
```

Validation regexp

```
/[a-f0-9]{8}-[a-f0-9]{4}-4[a-f0-9]{3}-[89aAbB][a-f0-9]{3}-[a-f0-9]{12}/
```

# Algorithms

- v1
    - involved mac address of computer and timestamp
    - reveals the identity of the computer that made it
    - UUID is 128 bit long
    - Example of how the Ruby UUID gem creates
        - 60-bit time value (15 hex digits)
            - taken from system clock
        - 16-bit sequence number (4 hex digits)
            - required as clock could be set backwards so time alone does not
              guarantee uniqueness
            - incremented each time the UUID generator is started
        - 48-bit node identifier (12 hex digits)
            - mac address of the machine used
            - postgres `uuid_generate_v1()` does indeed show my mac address as
              the final 12 digits
        - postgres `uuid_generate_v1()` does not seem to use this exactly - it
          generates:
        ```
        # notice only the first 8 hex digits change
        # the last block is the mac address of the en0 interface
        4fe43fc6-b151-11e4-b432-8438354d9c88
        789a1b84-b151-11e4-b432-8438354d9c88
        7ccdeec4-b151-11e4-b432-8438354d9c88
        ```
- v3
    - no random or environment dependant inputs so is fully reproducable
    - `uuid_generate_v3({namespace constant}, {string})`
    - the `{string}` is hashed with MD5 so theory not recoverable (see v5
      algorithm for improvement)
- v4
    - derived entirely from random numbers
    - ruby `SecureRandom.uuid` generates v4 UUIDs
- v5
    - same as v3 except the `{string}` is hashed with SHA-1 so more secure
    - this is preferred to v3 now

UUID values cannot be sorted in order of creation

## Implementations

### Postgres

```sql
# postgres
CREATE EXTENSION "uuid-ossp";
SELECT uuid_generate_v4();
# has all algorithms available - see
# http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/uuid-ossp.html
```

### Ruby

```ruby
require 'securerandom'
# uses algorithm v4 so is random
# uuid gem: https://github.com/assaf/uuid
SecureRandom.uuid
```
