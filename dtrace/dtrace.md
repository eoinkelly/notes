- dtrace is basically strace++
- uses its own programming language called "D" (which, confusingly, is not the
  same as the lang which is the successor to C of the same name)
- provides the `D` language for creating tracing scripts
    - D allows you to summarize data in kernel space before being passed over to
      userland which makes it fast enough to use on production systems.
    - very limited language by design because it is running in the kernel on
      production machines
    - e.g. of limitations
        - has no loops
    - is heavily inspired by awk (looks like C and awk had a child)
    - has `.d` file extension
- DTrace can instrument ALL software:
    - userland stuff: databases, apps etc.
    - kernel code
    - device drivers
- d is short for "dynamic tracking"
    - dynamic tracing is an instrumentation technique pioneered by DTrace
    - dynamically patches live running instructions with instrumentation code
- it can also do static tracing
    - user-friendly trace points are compiled-in that dtrace can hook into
- There are various GUIs that use DTrace underneath
    - Apple's Instruments
    - Joyent's Cloud Analytics
    - ZFS Storage Analytics

- The DTrace Toolkit
    - MacOS includes a bunch of scripts from this toolkit in `/usr/bin`

> Mac OS X has a flag (P_LNOATTACH) that a program may set that disallows
> tracing of that process by debugging utilities such as DTrace and gdb

- Language providers
    - allows DTRace to see more context of the code
    - support for Ruby, Erlang
- Application providers
    - Allows DTrace to follow execution from app to kernel and back
    - Postgres and MySQL support this
- Linux support
    - Oracle announced official implementation in 2012 but not released yet
    - A linux port has existed since 2008
    - `SystemTap` does a similar thing on linux
    - Linux seems to achieve similar goals with a mix of tools

        - NOTE: this page has lots of GREAT resources for profiling system
          performance on Linux

Probes

- are names for events that happen
- an application can add "user defined probes" to help you instrument it with
  dtrace
    - examples of apps which provide their own probes
        - ruby
        - java
        - postgres
        - mysql
