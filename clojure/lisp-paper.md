Maths ideas we will need

1. Partial function
    - only defined on part of its domain (its set of possible input values)
    - they arise in functions used in computation because there are some inputs
      which would cause the computation to never finish
1. Propositional expressions and predicated
    - T = Truty
    - F = False
    - and, or, not (in the logic sense)
    - A predicate is an _expression_ whose _range_ consists of T and F (i.e. the
      only possible output values it can have are T or F)
