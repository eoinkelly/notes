Apache has many ways of doing multiprocessing

1. MPM Prefork
    - parent process spawns worker children
    - each child has a single thread
    - required if you are running a module which isn't threadsfe e.g. mod_php
    - -- can be resource intensive comapred to other MPM options
1. MPM Worker
    - parent process spawns worker children
    - each child can have many threads
    - more efficient than MPM Prefork in most cases
1. MPM Event
    - Similar to MPM worker
    - Each child process has a listener thread which directs request to a worker
      thread
    - helps avoid threads getting stuck with long KeepAliveTimeouts
1. mpm_winnt
    - Windows MPM
1. Others
    - there are a few more niche MPM options

The exact configuration directives available depend on which MPM module you are
using

Default apache `Timeout` is 60s which is quite long - maybe we should shorten?
What is the timeout for an ELB?
