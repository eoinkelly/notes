## What are the base technologies of offline browser storage?

1. IndexedDB
    - fairly widespread adoption in newest browsers
        - incomplete in IE 10/11
        - will be in safari 8
    - async access
    - much larger storage limits (firefox will ask user at 50 MB), unlimited
    - (with user permission) in chrome
2. WebSQL (is dead spec)
    - there is a cordova plugin that implements the webSQL api using a native
      SQLite impelmentation so this
    - this would allow our cordova apps to have access to a SQL store so this
      spec (although dead in browser) might have some legs yet!
3. localStorage
    - implemented everywhere
    - access is synchronous
    - not available in private browsing mode on ios/android
    - occasionally gets cleared out on ios 5,6
        - ?? does this still happen???
        - ? how much can I depend on localstorage to always be there?

## LevelDB

- is google implementation of IndexedDB
- is used by Google to implement IndexedDB support in Chrome
- can be used as a backend for Riak
- soon to be a backend for MariaDB
- is very fast - outperforms SQLite and Kyoto Cabinet (according to wikipedia)

## LevelUP API

- In node _levelUP_ is an API to datastores
- It came about by splitting the Node LevelDB adapter into two layers
    1. LevelUP
    2. LevelDOWN
- lots of datastores implement the LevelUP API
    - levelDOWN (the bit of levelDB that implements it)
    - Riak
    - Redis
    - Level.js

Level.js _ browser based implementation of LevelUP API _ uses IndexedDB under
the hood. \* allows you to use the node LevelUP API in the browser

https://github.com/jensarps/IDBWrapper \* a x-browser wrapper for IndexedDB

## PouchDB

- provides a high-level
- a possible alternative is lawnchair http://brian.io/lawnchair/

## Appcache

Method of defining web page files to be cached using a cache manifest file,
allowing them to work offline on subsequent visits to the page

- solves a different problem to the storage stuff above
- good x-browser support
- has reputation of being buggy and hard to work with

QUESTION: are there newer, better alternatives to this?

# Browser storage technologies

http://www.webdirections.org/blog/webstorage-persistent-client-side-data-storage/

1. cookies
1. local storage
1. session storage

session = while the "top level browsing context" (window or tab) remains open
and the URL points at the same "origin" (domain)

To have access to each otherâ€™s webStorage, tabs or windows must have the same

1. protocol
1. subdomains
1. top-level domain

### sessionStorage

- stores data during a session and is removed once a session is finished.
- if user goes to another site and navigates back it is still in the same
  session
- is **not** shared between tabs/windows
- is shared with "sub frames" (? iframes or html frames) on the same page
- some browsers will persist it across a browser crash, some do not

```js
var ss = window.sessionStorage;
if (ss) {
    try {
        // use it
        ss.setItem('key', 'value');
        ss.getItem('key');
        ss.getItem('notThere'); // => null
        // returns null if key does not exist
    } catch (e) {
        //test if this is a QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR
    }
} else {
    // fallback to cookies or something else
}
```

Gotchas

- All data is stored as strings (so objects must be serialized first)
- JS strings are UTF-16 encoded so each char takes up 2 bytes which effectively
  halves the available space
- Browsers do not provide reliable access to it during private browsing
    - safari: returns null for everything
    - chrome: lets you read previous values but does not persist localStorage
- webStorage (includes both localStorage and sessionStorage) is synchronous!

Limits

- Spec recommends 5MB per domain (16 byte JS chars means we get 2.5 MB)
  QUESTION: as total for session + local or each?
- `setItem` will throw an error if you try to write past the limit

Events

Only fired when storage is **changed**

QUESTION: is it fired on session, local or both?

```js
window.addEventListener('storage', function (storageArea) {}, false);
```

- The event is mostly not received in the window/tab that changed the storage -
  it is received in the other open windows/tabs for that domain (some browsers
  do also issue it in window/tab that madt the change)

### localStorage

- localStorage is almost identical to sessionStorage, but the data stored
  persists indefinitely, until removed by the application.

Gotchas

- iOS 5/6 will sometimes just delete it
