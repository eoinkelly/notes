## Disassembly of BEAM code

BEAM has 158 instructions

The erlang compiler can generate

1. byte code (.beam files)
2. erlang assembly (.S files)

When a `.beam` file is loaded into the VM it is transformed:

- some instructions are merged together into "super instructions" for efficiency
- some instructions are replaced e.g. addition replaced with increment

It is this "transformed representation" that is run. You can peek at the
transformed representation by "disassembling" the loaded module.

```
# Pipeline from elixir code to the binary data actually run by the erlang VM

{1: elixir (.ex) file}
    |
    |
[elixir compiler]
    |
    |
{2: erlang assembly (.S) file}
    |
    |
[erlang compiler (maybe?)]
    |
    |
{3: erlang bytecode (.beam) file}
    |
    |
[BEAM Optimizer]
    |
    |
{4: transformed represntation (.dis) file}


# Pipeline from elixir code to the binary data actually run by the erlang VM
(I *think* this is correct)

{1: erlang (.erl) file}
    |
    |
[erlang compiler]
    |
    |
{2: core erlang}
    |
    |
[erlang compiler]
    |
    |
{3: erlang assembly (.S) file}
    |
    |
[erlang compiler]
    |
    |
{4: erlang bytecode (.beam) file}
    |
    |
[BEAM Optimizer]
    |
    |
{4: transformed represntation (.dis) file}
```

The "erlang abstract format" is in there somewhere ???

```
# {1} edit simple.ex in editor

# {1} -> {2} -> {3}
# create Elixir.Simple.beam
elixirc simple.ex

# {1} -> {2}
# creates simple.ex.S
ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS="'S'" elixirc simple.ex

%% {1} -> {2} -> {3}
%% compile an elixir file
iex> c("simple.ex")

%% disassemble it
%% {3} -> {4}
iex> :erts_debug.df(Simple)
# creates Elixir.Simple.dis
```

## .dis files

- created by `:erts_debug.df`
- disassembled BEAM code
- represents the code that is actually run (after BEAM optimizer has run)
- notice that to get at what really runs on the VM you have to disassemble a
  .beam
    - I don't know how to get from a `.S` to the `.dis` directly

### erlang disassembly file format

The format of each line is:

```
memory_address: instruction_operand_types arg0 arg1 ...
```

Operand types include

- I = integer
- a = atom

etc.

Move instructions in disassembly seem to be of the form `move src dst`

Things I noticed in the disassembly

- module name
    - becomes a single atom even if it has `.` e.g. `Elixir.Simple` becomes atom
      `'Elixir.Simple'`
    - are prefixed with the `Elixir` namespace e.g. `defmodule Simple` becomes
      `Elixir.Simple`
- each module gets its own implementation of `module_info/1` that wraps around
  the built-in erlang `erlang:get_module_info/2`
- function names are atoms

## BEAM architecture

- BEAM has virtual registers like a real CPU would
- BEAM is a register based machine - other examples
    - Android dalvic
    - Parrot
    - Lua
- JAV (Joes abstract machine) was a stack based machine
    - other examples of stack based VMs
        - JVM
        - Forth
    - a stack based machine has no registers

Compared to a Register VM, a Stack based VM is:

- ++ simpler to implement than register based VM
- ++ more compact bytecode

* ++ minimal CPU state

- -- potentially increased memory access (you move a lot of stuff around)
- -- no virtual registers to map to real ones (potentially uses underlying
  hardware less efficiently)

Register based VM can get really good results from "threading" bytecode (not the
concurrent kind of threading) - it is a method of dispatching the next
instruction from the previous.

## BEAM registers

```plain
| Register       | Purpose                     | Appears in .dis code as
|================|=============================|========================
| R0 - R255      | general purpose             | x(n)
| FR0 - FR15     | floating point operations   | fr(n)
| tmpA, tmpB     | temporary registers         | not visible in code
| stack slots    | local variables             | y(n)
```

The BEAM is strongly typed - it has a bunch of instructions for type checking:

- is_integer
- is_tuple
- etc.

## Elixir on the BEAM

- Elixir compiles into BEAM byte code (via Erlang Abstract Format).
- All Elixir modules start with the Elixir. prefix followed by the regular
  Elixir name.

To invoke an elixir module from erlang

```erlang
'Elixir.SomeModule':some_func(Arg1).
```

- Elixir itself is structured similar to Erlangâ€™s OTP.
- It is divided into applications that are placed inside the lib directory

## Erlang compliler

- If you pass `debug_info` to the erlang compliler it will include that debug
  info in the form of "abstract" code.
- Erlang debugging tools like
    - Debugger
    - Xref
    - Cover require this info to be present.
- Debugging info can also be encrypted (presumably for distribution of
  debuggable builds to clients).

You can pass

- output of parser step via `'P'` option
- output after _all_ sources transfromations via `'E'` option
- output assembler code via `'S'` option

> Elixir also brings a new underlying AST to the table, instead of the Erlang
> AST where everything form has its own representation, the Elixir AST has a far
> more uniform representation, which makes meta-programming far easier.

NB: The elixir AST is not the same as the erlang one!

> In elixir variables can be re-bound in sequences. This is actually ok, the
> resulting forms can still be normalized into a static-single-assignment (SSA)
> form.
