        - authentication: YES
        - authorization: NO

        - confirmable users: NO
- https://github.com/hassox/guardian_db
    - works with guardian
    - by default guardian doesn't store tokens anywhere when it generates them
      for authenticated users
    - guardian_db stores the token in the DB and will check the token provided
      by the user against the DB each time.
    - it will also remove the token from DB when it is revoked (user logs out)
        - without this, guardian tokens can basically be used for ever
            - -- relies on the browser/client to actually throw it away
- https://github.com/ueberauth/ueberauth
    - is a _framework_
    - allows users to prove their identity to the app
    - does NOT authenticate each request - guardian does this
    - has a bunch of strategies
        - each strategy is a plug
        - strategies for authenticating against variou oauth2 providers e.g.
          google, facebook
        - the "identity strategy" allows you to authenticate with your own app

    - uses comeonin for password hashing
- https://github.com/britton-jb/sentinel
    - is attempting to be devise
    - -- is immature
    - uses guardian and guardian_db, comeonin, bamboo

guardian + ueberauth + ueberauth_identity = an auth solution _ but is missing
confirmable, invitable users _ also missing user management of their own stuff
