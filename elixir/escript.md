Escript is ...

- escript provides support for running short Erlang programs without having to
  compile them first and an easy way to retrieve the command line arguments.
- An escript can run on any machine that has Erlang installed
- by default does not require Elixir to be installed, as Elixir is embedded as
  part of the escript.
- `mix escript.build` task guarantees the project and its dependencies are
  compiled and packages them inside an escript.
- the escript file is a pkzip file with a short text header
- `unzip` command works on it
    - it unzips to a bunch of `elixir_*.beam` files and a few `*.app` files
    - `.app` files are text and contain what seems like a text representation of
      an elixir map that shows the metadata and dependencies of the app.
