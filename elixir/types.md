## Dialyzer

- is a static analysis tool for `.beam` files (not .erl or .ex)
- can be useful even without adding typings (also called "type specs" or "type
  hints") to the code
- use `dialyxer` to integrate it with a mix project
- is based on the "Success Typings" paper
  http://user.it.uu.se/~kostis/Papers/succ_types.pdf
- Persistent lookup table (PLT)
    - the cached output of dialyzers analysis
    - saves time so you don't have to re-run on files which have not changed
- dialyxir
    - stores PLT files under `$MIX_HOME`
        - stores one PLT for each erlang/OTP version
        - stores one PLT for each erlang/OTP verions + Elixir version
        - stores a project specific PLT under `_build/env`
    - the core `.plt` files are just copied to your project if they already
      exist

what is a PLT?

```
# First install dialyxir

$ mix dialyzer
# The first run of dialyzer on your machine will be **very slow**

$ mix dialyzer.explain # list info about a all known warnings
$ mix dialyzer.explain some_warning_name # list info about a single warning
```
