Generic stage

- a high level abstraction over erlang processes for managing concurrent
  execution
- three types of stage
    1. producer
    1. consumer
    1. producer-consumer

stages exchange "events" your stages are wired into a pipeline GenStage has
built-in back pressure so if one stage is slow the backpressure will slow/stop
the production of events has a way to signal betwene processes about their
businesses stages are demand driven

1. consumer subscribes to a producer
2. consumer tells producer how many event it is willing to accept
3. producer sends at most that many events

consumer can send new messages to the producer about how many events it can now
handle => consumption is demand driven each stage runs in its own process so
each stage is running concurrently GenStage is essentially just a message
contract or protocol

Consumers have configuration options max_demand - how much to ask for in any one
message min_demand - how much to have left to process before asking for more
