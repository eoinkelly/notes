# Timezones

Good articles:

- https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2019/03/27/storing-utc-is-not-a-silver-bullet/
- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.3.5

## Recommendation

The iCalendar spec (RFC 5545 above) recommends using

    TZID=America/New_York:19980119T020000

as a fairly robust way of storing a future date which should allow for changes
in tz data. This matches option 3 in the Jon Skeet article linked above.

In DB terms this would be

    human_time String
    timezone_id String

Q: what postgres type is best to use for both these fields? Question: what does
rails do out of the box?

## The canonical Timezone database

https://www.iana.org/time-zones

> The Time Zone Database (often called tz or zoneinfo) contains code and data
> that represent the history of local time for many representative locations
> around the globe. It is updated periodically to reflect changes made by
> political bodies to time zone boundaries, UTC offsets, and daylight-saving
> rules.

- IANA releases an updated Timezone database periodically (a few times a year)
- Dataset
    - is approx 500kb zipped
    - a bunch of text files with dates and GMT offsets
    - docs, helper scripts, helper C code
- Programming environments reformat that DB for their own usage and import it

## How operating systems manage TZ data

### Ubuntu

- Ubuntu keeps the TZ data in `/usr/share/zoneinfo/`
- The data is a bunch of binary files in
  `NZ: timezone data, version 2, 7 gmt time flags, 7 std time flags, no leap seconds, 156 transition times, 7 abbreviation chars`
  format.
- `tzdata` package. `apt update && apt upgrade tzdata` to get latest version

```

### macOS

- Apple will push updated info to your device periodically - see
  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206986
- macOS requires a restart to accept it
- macOS keeps the TZ data in `/usr/share/zoneinfo/`

### Windows

- Presumably Windows does something similar to macOS

## How Elixir manages TZ data

- https://github.com/lau/tzdata
- The package will (at startup) do an automatic download of the new TZ database
  release when one is available

## How Ruby manages TZ data

Ruby uses the `tzinfo` gem

### tzinfo

- https://github.com/tzinfo/tzinfo

- TZInfo requires a source of time zone data. There are two options:
    1. A zoneinfo directory containing timezone definition files. These files
       are generated from the
       [IANA Time Zone Database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones) using the
       `zic` utility. Most Unix-like systems include a zoneinfo directory.
    2. The TZInfo::Data library (the tzinfo-data gem). TZInfo::Data contains a
       set of Ruby modules that are also generated from the IANA Time Zone
       Database.

By default, TZInfo will attempt to use TZInfo::Data. If TZInfo::Data is not
available (i.e. if `require 'tzinfo/data'` fails), then TZInfo will search for a
zoneinfo directory instead (using the search path specified by
`TZInfo::ZoneinfoDataSource::DEFAULT_SEARCH_PATH`).

If no data source can be found, a `TZInfo::DataSourceNotFound` exception will be
raised when TZInfo is used.

```
# on macos
[2] pry(main)> require "tzinfo"
=> true
[3] pry(main)> TZInfo::ZoneinfoDataSource::DEFAULT_SEARCH_PATH
=> ["/usr/share/zoneinfo", "/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo", "/etc/zoneinfo"]
```

### tzinfo-data gem

- https://github.com/tzinfo/tzinfo-data
- contains the tz database for ruby
- releases new versions corresponding to the IANA DB releases
- is automatically used by `tzinfo` if present
- is not installed by Rails by default

### Rails

- Rails requires `tzinfo` via `activesupport` but does not include `tzinfo-data`
- Seems to use the OS tz data by default

## How JS manages TZ data

- There seem to be a few options for TZ aware date calculations in Node
- Example NPM packages for node:
    - https://www.npmjs.com/package/timezonecomplete (a library which uses the
      data)
    - https://www.npmjs.com/package/tzdata (the actualy tz data)
