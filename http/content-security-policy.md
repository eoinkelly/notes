# Content security policy

Basics

- a single HTTP header `Content-Security-Policy`
    - there were other headers in the past but they are deprecated now
- two versions of the spec:
    - CSP 1.0 (all browsers except IE)
        - https://caniuse.com/#feat=contentsecuritypolicy
        - IE 11 supports the `X-Content-Security-Policy` header but using that
          header with the standard one causes bugs in other browsers so is not
          recommended
    - CSP Level 2 (all recent browsers (Firefox had a niggle)
        - https://caniuse.com/#feat=contentsecuritypolicy2
        - lets you whitelist scripts with a hash in the header

```
Content-Security-Policy: {directive}; {directive};
```

- header value is one or more directives separated by `;`
- there are 15 directives documented in the 1.0 spec
- A single directive can have multiple sources
- If a directive has multiple sources, they are ??? together to make the rule

- Never add `unsafe-inline` to the `script-src` directive - it pretty much
  defeats the purpose of CSP
    - this means Google Analytics and friends will not work in their default
      configuration

To get Google Analytics working

1. Move it to a separate script file and load it into HTML via
   `<script src="whatever/ga.js"></script>` tag
2. Set
   `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none';script-src 'self' www.google-analytics.com;img-src www.google-analytics.com;`

Sources

- `'self'` (the single quotes are a required part of the value)
    - allows loading resources from the same origin (same scheme, same host,
      same port)
        - note that this does not include path!
- `https:` (the colon is part of the value)
    - allows loading resources over HTTPS on any domain i.e. it locks down the
      URL scheme but nothing else

## CSP 2.0 Spec

> Individual inline scripts and stylesheets may be whitelisted via nonces and
> hashes

Terms

- Security policy
    - the HTTP header value as a whole creates a policy
    - contains a set of "security policy directives"
- Security policy directive
    - declares restrictions for a particular resource type e.g. `script-src`
    - each directive has a name and a value

Security policies are applied by user-agents (browsers) to a specific "resource
representation" known as a "protected resource"

Policy delivery can happen in two ways:

1. Via one of two HTTP headers:
    - Enforce the policy:
        ````
        Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'
        	```
        ````
    - Warn about violations but do not enforce:
        ````
        Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: script-src 'self'
        	```
        ````
1. Via HTML meta tag
    - `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="script-src 'self'">`

If not specified explicitly in the policy, the directives listed below will use
the `default-src` sources as their source list.

    child-src
    connect-src
    font-src
    img-src
    media-src
    object-src
    script-src
    style-src
