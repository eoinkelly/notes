1. Name
2. Value
3. Domain
    - hosts which the browser should send this cookie back to
        - subdomains are included e.g. `Domain=mozilla.org` will include this
          cookie on `foo.mozilla.org` and `bar.mozilla.org`
    - defaults to the host of the current document if missing **excluding
      subdomains**

    - browser will only send the cookie to a URL which contains this path
5. Expires
    - used to set cookie expiry
6. Max-Age
    - used to set cookie expiry
7. Size
8. HTTP flag
9. SameSite
    - not supported by all browsers
    - mitigated CSRF somewhat
10. Secure
    - the cookie should only be sent with HTTPS requests
    - if this flag is set then the cookie cannot be accessed by JS

## Cookie expiry

A cookie is automatically a "session cookie" i.e. will be deleted when the
browser tab is closed unless you specify an Expires or Max-Age directive in the
cookie

- Expires sets a date & time that the cookie should expire
- Max-Age sets a maxiumum age of the cookie in (date and time are relative to
  the client not the server)

> web browsers may use session restoring, which makes most session cookies
> permanent, as if the browser was never closed

Session restore

- Browsers will automagically keep your "session" going in some cases
    - e.g. Firefox
        - browser crash
        - addon install
        - user explicitly asks for a session restore

## Cookie scope

- Domain and Path together decide the scope of the cookie

## Setting cookies

Set a cookie by setting a `Set-Cookie` header in the response The browser will
return it back to you in the `Cookie` header

```
Set-Cookie: <cookie-name>=<cookie-value>

Set-Cookie: _healthpromotion_session=U2tOUENhNFVTdTRwcmtKNkVCQnIvckZmSHd2anYycjZQaWtJUnliN3dPcEZmTlY4ZVIwM2tKWU9xdEZlRXdGcVhlc09mRmtNM0w4RGpUaU9sMjM0UVhvY2QvUXh5S3FnQTRYSWJaQnpZamhZRjlYV2RtZFc3RW5HUmpxZEhabXA5aElWKzNXRVl6R1BRUGtuZWN3c3dRPT0tLXNYVnk3b2ljWkJlSkV1a09BY3AxbUE9PQ%3D%3D--867fbc5759582366b914f00b9c1274e030999499; path=/; HttpOnly
