# typedef

- creates aliases for types
    - does NOT _create_ new types in any way!
    - there are no new semantics
    - it is a bit like a fancy `#define`
- lets you make a synonym for an _existing_ type.
- uses
    - make program easier to read especially with complicated structures
    - parameterise the program against portability problems
        - example: if you typedef the platform `int` to `size_t` then you can
          handle portability issues by adjusting the typedef
- K&R uses a convention where new types have uppercase names
    - seems to be followed sometimes but not always in postgres codebase
- it is handy for structs to avoid having to type the `struct struct_label_name`
  every time you want to use it as a type

```c
// typedef existing_type new_name;
typedef char * String;
typedef int Coordinate;

// this creates funky as an alias for a function which takes two `char *` and
// returns an int. It is just an alias and does not allocate any storage for a
// pointer!
typedef int (*funky)(char *, char *);

// allocate storage for a function pointer
funky pf;

// Examples from standard library
//
// * size_t
// * ptrdiff_t

typedef char * STRING;

// These do the same thing
char *s = "hi";
STRING s = "hi";

// it does the right thing with multiple declarations separated by commas:
STING name, comment;

// NB #define would get this wrong
#define STRING char *
STRING a, b, c; // Looks ok but because define is simple text substitution it becomes ...
char *a, b, c; // a is a pointer to a char, b is a char, c is a char
```

- is often used with structures to avoid typing `struct my_thing` every time you
  need to create one.
- by convention alias is UPPERCASE.
