* Expressions connected by `||` or `&&` are
    * evaluated left to right
    * garuanteed to stop as soon as the truth or falsehood is known
        * this is important for using it as a short-circuit operator later


`continue`
    * forces next iteration of `for` or `while` loop
`break`
    * within a loop it forces the loop to end and continue on with the code after the loop
    * within a `switch` statement it terminates a case

Note: C does not have a `next` statement no matter how many times Eoin's confused brain thinks it does.
