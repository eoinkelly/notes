- Expressions connected by `||` or `&&` are
    - evaluated left to right
    - garuanteed to stop as soon as the truth or falsehood is known
        - this is important for using it as a short-circuit operator later

`continue` _ forces next iteration of `for` or `while` loop `break` _ within a
loop it forces the loop to end and continue on with the code after the loop \*
within a `switch` statement it terminates a case

Note: C does not have a `next` statement no matter how many times Eoin's
confused brain thinks it does.
