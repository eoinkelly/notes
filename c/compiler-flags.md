Pro tip: **always enable warnings - they help lint your code and catch silly
mistakes**

- -O3
    - all optimizations enabled
- -O0
    - no optimizations enabled
    - use this when you need to debug so that compiled output matches your code
      as much as possible
- -Wall
    - show compiler warnings
- -Werror
    - treat warnings as errors
- -w1
    - show warnings but not compiler remarks
- -g
    - include debugging symbols
