Pro tip: **always enable warnings - they help lint your code and catch silly mistakes**

* -O3
    * all optimizations enabled
* -O0
    * no optimizations enabled
    * use this when you need to debug so that compiled output matches your code as much as possible
* -Wall
    * show compiler warnings
* -Werror
    * treat warnings as errors
* -w1
    * show warnings but not compiler remarks
* -g
    * include debugging symbols
