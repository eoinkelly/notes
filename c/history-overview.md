# Overview of C

- has no IO built-in - all IO is done by functions (not part of the language)
- has no operators to work with composite data structures
- is not stongly typed but has some type checking
    - you are not allowed to treat pointers and intergers as the same thing
    - you can use an explicit conversion
- Variables can be
    - internal to a function
    - visible to just the source file they are declared in
    - available globally

# History of C

- was an evolution of BCPL an B (both of which were typeless)
- The second edition of the _C Programming Language_ book (the K&R book)
    - came out in 1988 (first edition was 1978)
    - is a companion to ANSI C standard aka C89 (1989 was when ANSI
      standardised) aka C90 (1990 was when ISO standardised it)
    - made some minor changes to the language
        - documented the stdlib for the first time
- C99
    - introducted new features (many of which compilers had already introduced)
        - one-line comments
        - variadiac macros
        - `complex` type for complex numbers
        - `long long int`
    - macro `#define __STDC_VERSION__ = 199901L` to enable C99 features
- C11
    - adds numerous new features to C and the library, including
        - type generic macros,
        - anonymous structures,
        - improved Unicode support,
        - atomic operations,
        - multi-threading,
        - bounds-checked functions.
        - It also makes some portions of the existing C99 library optional, and
          improves compatibility with C++
    - macro `#define __STDC_VERSION__ = 201112L` to enable C11 features
- Embedded C
    - Historically, embedded C programming requires nonstandard extensions to
      the C language in order to support exotic features such as fixed-point
      arithmetic, multiple distinct memory banks, and basic I/O operations.
- compiler and C versions:
    - clang
        - defaults to `GNU C11 mode` (an extended version of c11 mode)
        - `gcc -std=c11`
    - gcc:
        - `gcc -std=c99`
        - `gcc -std=c11`
        - gcc 5 defaults to `GNU C11 mode` too (same as clang)
