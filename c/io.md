## IO in C

- C has a simple model of IO: text input and output is always represented as
  streams not matter where it is coming from or going to
- a stream is a collection of lines
- each line is 0+ characters terminated by a newline

```c
c = getchar() // reads the next character (byte) from an input stream
putchar(c) // writes a single character (byte) to an output stream
```

- getchar()
    - expands to `getc(stdin)`
    - returns an "unsigned char" converted to an int
    - returns a special `EOF` value when it reaches the end of the stream or an
      error occurs
        - EOF is a "negative integral constant"
        - EOF is an integer defined in stdio.h
        - the specific numeric value does not matter as long as it is not the
          same as any possible character

## `scanf`

- Reads a string from STDIN, optionally parses bits out of it and stores stuff
  in a memory location.
- First arg is a format specifier.
- Second arg is the _memory address_ that the data should be put.

```
scanf( "%s", &ages[3] );
```
