# structs

- items in a struct are called _structure members_

```c
// create structure template (does not allocate any memory)
struct person
{
    int age;
    char *name;
    int scores[5];
}
```

- _structure members_ are not necessairly stored contigiously in memory (so you
  shouldn't do pointer math with them)
- First you create a structure template (but this does not allocate any memory)
- `.` is the _member selection operator_
- If you have a pointer to a struture you use `->` ?? operator to get at
  members.

```c
struct person
{
    char name[255];
    int age;
}

typedef struct person PERSON;

struct person eoin = { "Eoin Kelly", 35 };
struct person *perpoi;
perpoi = &eoin;

printf("%s\n", (*perpoi).name); // dereference the pointer and call the member selection operator
printf("%s\n", perpoi->name);   // same thing (cleaner syntax)
```

- (nested) structures can be initialized with `{ ... }` same way (nested) arrays
  can.
- structures can be nested.
