## Arrays

- name of array is a pointer to its first element
    - implications
        - when array is passed to function the pointer is copied but not the
          array contents
- array declaration includes 1)element type and 2)no. of elements to allow the
  compiler to reserve storage

## Arrays

- are homogenous (all items must be same type)
- 0 based index
- must be sized when created
- defined by giving
    1. type
    2. name
    3. number of elements
- The name of the array is a pointer to its first element.
    - `=>` arrays are always passed to functions by reference
- Used to implement strings in C (string is an array of characters terminated by
  `\0` (null byte))

TODO: play with passing an array by value

```c
// type name[num-elements]
int ages[11];
```
