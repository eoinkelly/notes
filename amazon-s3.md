S3 = Simple Storage System

buckets are top level container (bit like top level dirs

- all files uploaded to S3 belong to a bucket
- bucket names must be unique across the whole S3 system

To access S3 you need

1. Access Key ID (identifies your S3 account)
2. Secret Access Key (akin to a password)

For an app to access files on S3 it needs

1. The S3 credentials (see above)
2. The name of the bucket that the files are in

The `aws s3` commands distinguish between 3 kinds of thing:

object prefix bucket
