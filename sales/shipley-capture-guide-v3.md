## 5 Principles

1. Align capture activities with the customers analysis and selection process
1. Influence customer to prefer your org and solution early and maintain the
   preference through selection, award, delivery
1. Base your strategy on the customers perception of reality
1. Align your actions and messages throughout the business development cycle
1. Use decision gate reviews of potential business opportunities for determining
   the best manner in which to proceed and color team reviews to improve quality
   of the product and outcome

## Capture planning

Questions this stuff is supposed to help answer

- How do I position my solution **and** org to win competitive business more
  effectively, efficiently and consistently?
    - Interesting that there are two parts to positioning - the solution and the
      org. Different thinking required for each?

Goal: win business opportunity by influencing the customer to prefer 1) your org
and 2) your solution

Capture planning is an **iterative** process for:

1. identify opportunities
1. assess the environment
1. implement winning strategies

To be consistent requires written, action oriented capture plans and the
discipline to implement, monitor and adapt those plans to

1. changing customer needs
2. internal issues
3. competitive conditions

How our position flows from the customers pov:

```
Unknown -> Known -> Improved -> Favoured
```

How to move between positions:

- Unknown -> Known
    - Research the market, interact with customer, analyse findings
- Known -> Improved
    - Develop your strategy and tactics, implement the strategy, validate it
      with the customer
- Improved -> Favoured
    - Iterate on the capture planning progress as often as required, adjusting
      it based on your new starting position

There are 4 potential outcomes of capture planning

1. Customer wants to negotiate contract without competition (best)
    - Preparing RFP docs is time consuming and expensive
    - They don't feel they will find a better solution than ours
    - Get a solution promptly has more benefits to them than the potential cost
      savings of competitive bidding
1. Customer prefers us but asks for proposals from others because
    - Regulations require them to
    - competitive bids provide better solutions
    - competitive bids provide lower prices
    - competitive bids less likely to be questioned by senior management and
      regulation authorities
    - competitive bids give them extra knowledge and leverage in contract
      negotiations
1. Customer opts for "fair and open" competition
    - Competition is almost never truly fair and open, despite what customers
      say
    - Deciding whether it truly is fair and open is an important goal of the
      process
        - Can we influence it in our favour?
1. Customer prefers another orgs solution, keeps us around as leverage on their
   price/solution
    - We should not stay in this bid unless we have evidence that doing so will
      lead to **profitable** future business

The usual context for capture planning is when you are chasing complex
opportunities with some or all of:

- High value or strategic significance
- Loosely understood requirements, at least in the early phases
- Buying committees or teams rather than single purchaser
- Selling committees or teams with many skills and disciplines
- Long sales cycles (months and years)
- Significant communication prior to a solicitation between the buying and
  selling teams (meetings, document exchanges)
- Formally structured procurement environments

Talented individuals can win smaller opportunities. Winning larger opportunities
requires a team and that requires some process.

A capture plan is a 1) written and 2) action oriented set of steps to influence
the customer to prefer our org and our solution.

Capture planning is a disciplined approach to influencing customers to favour
our org and our solution **before** the actual procurement begins. It can also
influence during procurement if that is allowed by the procurement rules.

A capture plan relies on research about 1) the customer, 2) competitors, 3) the
opportunity.

The length and complexity of your capture vary by customer and opportunity.
