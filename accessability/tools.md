- capybara-accessible
    - https://blog.pivotal.io/labs/labs/automated-accessibility-testing-rails
    - hits the google accessabilty API
    - wraps around the selenium capybara driver
    - hasn't been updated in 2 years
    - https://github.com/casecommons/capybara-accessible
    - ++ doesn't require you to write explicit "should be accessible test"
- https://github.com/bbc/bbc-a11y
    - checks a given set of URLs agains the BBC accessibility standards
    - creates a `a11y` command, functions a bit like the google `a11y` npm
      package except it checks BBC standards, not google ones
    - -- you have to manually specify each URL to hit
    - -- that means you'll have to so manual setup to get the app into a state
      there that URL can be tested e.g. logged in etc.
- http://khan.github.io/tota11y/
    - javascript thing that pops up on the page and lets you test accessibility
    - https://github.com/stevenspiel/tota11y-rails is a gem that enables it in
      rails
    - ++ seems pretty nice
    - ++ no testing overhead
    - -- needs to be explicitly turned on
    - could be turned on in development for manual checking and helping devs
      understand what they are making
    - ?? is it better than the google accessibility tools addon
- google's `a11y` npm package
- google's browser dev tools addon that does an a11y audit of the page
