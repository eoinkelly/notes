Colors are unusable Do not rely on color alone to convey meaning Users expect
links to take them somewhere Don't write scripts in links that don't have true
destinations associated with them (e.g. href="javascript: function(this)")

# WCAG guidelines

http://webstandards.govt.nz/

accessibility checker

A set of guidelines for making content accessible, primarily for disabled users
but also for limited devices like phones

- priority 1 = **must** satisfy these requirements
- priority 2 = should satisfy these requirements
- priority 3 = **may** satisfy these requirements version 2.0 released in 2008

The US government has a similar set of standards in Section 508 (partly based on
WCAG 1.0) 7% of US population are colorblind approx 1 in 14

3 options for dealing with this

1. when conveying information don't use color alone (best option)
2. don't use problematic colors side-by-side (use Photoshop plugin to check)
3. daltonize the content (extreme measure)
