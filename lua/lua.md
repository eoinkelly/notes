# Lua

- is a _tabled based_ programming language
- has 21 keywords
- 5.3 supports explicit integers and bitwise operators
- has both
    1. an interpreter + repl `lua`
    2. compiler `luac`
- uses prototype objects - like JS
    - Classes and objects are not separate concepts
    - You con't create a blueprint for an object (class) and then create an
      intance of it (object). Instead you just create an object and clone it to
      make new instances.
- is dynamically typed
- variables can be assigned values of a new type
- Standard library
    - lua has a standard lib and it seems to be just magically available in all
      lua code
- Lua will do type coercion pretty freely:
    ```lua
    > "10" + 1
    11.0
    > "10" .. 123
    10123
    ```
- Scope
    - lua calls scopes chunks
    - There is a global scope
        - Every file has its own scope
            - every `do end` opens a new scope
            - every function definition opens a new chunk/scope
    - Scopes have access to everything in their (lexical) parent scope
- variables declared without `local` are global **no matter what chunk they are
  declared in**
- logical operators vs relational operators
    - `==` and `~=` are relational operators
        - they compare two values and **always** return a `boolean` result
    - `and`, `or` are logical operators - they always return **one of their
      operands**
        - `and` returns the second operator if both are true
        - they do NOT evaluate to a boolean result
        - `and` and `or` both use shortcut evaluation - avoid combining them
          with functions with side-effects
    - `not` is a logical operator but it does return a `boolean`

    ```lua
    k

    ```

- only `false` and `nil` are falsy, everything else is truthy
- iteration
    - use `pairs()` to yield **all** keys (and their values) from a table
    - use `ipairs()` to yield only numeric keys (and their values) from a table
    - In the syntax below, ITERATOR_FUNC can be any function that returns enough
      values as it is called repeatedly - the first time it returns `nil` the
      iteration will stop. Combined with returning an anonymous function which
      accesses variables declared outside it in your ITERATOR_FUNC, your
      ITERATOR_FUNC can statefully walk across a data structure pretty easily
        ```lua
        for VARIABLES in ITERATOR_FUNC do
        end
        ```
- global variables in lua live in an invisible table exposed as `_G`
    ```lua
    -- all these are the same thing
    foo = 12
    _G.foo = 12
    _G["foo"] = 12
    ```
- You can get at the table which holds all the `local` variable assignments
  within a function via `_ENV` within that function
    - `_ENV` points at `_G` in the global scope
- Lua doesn't have built-in classes but you can build a prototypal inheritance
  system pretty easily with metatables.
    - create a "prototype" object
    - create a constructor function which returns a new object which has a
      metatable where the `__index` has been set to point at the prototype so
      that any missing values will be looked up in the prototype

- if you call a function in a table with `:` instead of `.` it will
  automatically pass in a reference to the table as a first object to the
  function
    - this bit of sugar makes the lua code look more OOish

## Modules

- Lua has multiple ways of creating and loading modules - this is just one
  method

- a module is a lua table
- a module file is a lua file which returns a table
- basically you build up a table in your file and then `return` it at the top
  level of the file
- `require(filenameWithoutLuaExtension)`
    - evaluates the file?
    - is smart enough not to reload a file it has already loaded (similar to
      Ruby `require`)
    - returns a table
    - it searches for the file on `package.paths` (a `;` separated string of
      paths)
- you can save state into a file as lua code and then later `require` that file
  and lua will build a table for it
    - this means you don't have to serialize/deserialize the state into another
      format like JSON/YAML etc.
        - obviously there are downsides to this too but it seems useful in the
          right time & place
- if you need an equivalent of Ruby `load` then it is `dofile(pathToFile)` which
  will just reload the file every time you call it
    - it does not search `package.path`

## Types

Lua has 8 basic types

1. nil
    - is the value that variables which have not been assigned have
    - any unrecognised identifier in your code will return `nil` e.g.
    ```lua
    > print(asdfasdl)
    nil
    > asddsfff
    nil
    ```
1. boolean
    - values are: true|false

    ```lua
    foo = true
    bar = false

    a == b -- test for equality
    a ~= b -- test for inequality
    ```

1. number
    - seems to be floating point like JS
1. string
    - literals can be enclosed in single or double quotes
    - double quotes seem to be more conventional
    - examples
        ```lua
        -- escape chars work with any kind of quote
        > "he\nlo"
        he
        lo
        > 'he\nlo'
        he
        lo
        ```
1. function
    - names seem to be `CamelCasedWithInitialCap()`
    - like old-school JS you can pass more args to a function than you have
      declared params
        - if you pass fewer args the missing values are filled in with nil
    - return `nil` if you don't add an explicit return statement
        - quirk: `return` must be followed by `end` so you have to wrap early
          returns in `do end` e.g.
    - functions are first class, you can pass them around as values

        ```lua
        function buildThing()
          -- other stuff

          -- return anonymous function
          return function()
            print("hi")
          end
        end
        ```

    - functions act as closures over their surrounding lexical scopes just like
      in JS
    - can return multiple values by just separating them with commas
    - if you return N values but assign fewer then the extra values are just
      discarded
    - keys are accessed by `[]` but if keys are strings you can use `.`
    - if you use a key which doesn't exist you get `nil` back
    - table "constructor" is the literal syntax
        ```lua
        x = {
            k1 = "hi"
            k2 = 1234
        }
        ```
    - tables are assigned and passed to functions by reference
    - Arrays
        - are tables with numeric keys
        - lua does NOT support multidimensional arrays directly but you can do
          them as nested tables
        - indices start at 1 not 0
            - you can use any keys you want but
                - `#` length operator will only count keys starting at 1
                - `#` considers an array to be finsihed if it finds two `nil`s
                  in a row so be careful with sparse arrays!
        - lua might actually allocate the "array" contigiously in memory iff
            1. all table keys are nubmers
            2. numeric indeces start at 1 (not 0!!!)
            3. at least half the indices are not nil
        - have a construdtor similar to C
            ```lua
            myarry = { "hello", "here", "hi" }
            ```

1. table
    - a set of key-value pairs
    - array-meets-dictionalry object that can be used for many things
    - the only data structure in lua
    - any type except `nil` can be a key, values can have any type
1. userdata
1. thread
    - used to run code in parallel - how?

Note: no array type

Are semicolos required?

```lua
-- are comments

-- assignment works as you would expect
foo = "hello"

-- multiple assignment works too
a, b = 123, "hi"

-- print() is a bit like console.log - it will print anything you give it
```

## Control structures

```lua

if SOME_BOOLEAN_CONDITION then
  -- statements
elseif SOME_OTHER_CONDITION then
else
end

while CONDITION do
  break -- works as you would expect
end

repeat
  -- statements
until CONDITION

-- for loops are very constrained compared to other langs
-- they can only assign one variable which must be numeric and they force you to increment/decrement it
-- they are really just for counting through a set of numbers
for
```

## Meta tables

- meta tables are just tables with some keys which have pre-arranged meanings
- you can attach a metatable to a table with
  `setmetatable(targettable, metatable)`. After that, lua will look for certain
  keys in the metatable when you try to perform certain actions on the table.
- tables have a `nil` metatable by default
- `getmetatable(table)` will return the meta table for `table`

Useful metatable methods

- `__index = function(containertable, key)` value is a function which will be
  called if an unknown key is requested from the container table
    - acts like a getter but it called for all keys in the table
    - `rawget(table, key)` can be used to bypass `__index`
- `__newindex = function(containertable, key, value)` called when a new value is
  added to the table
    - acts like a setter but is one setter called for all keys in the table
    - `rawset(table, key)` can be used to bypass `__newindex`
- `__call = function(containertable, otherargs...)` lets you call a table like a
  function, passing in whatever args you like
    - lua calls this a _functable_ but other langs call it _functor_
    - functables let you couple state with a function

## Built-in functions

```lua

type() -- -> string describing the type

math.floor()
math.ceil()


string.len()

-- # is the length operator (a unary operator)
#"string literal" -- same as string.len("string literal")

.. -- concatenate strings
tostring() -- explicitly coerce value to string


-- read from stdin
my_input = io.read()
```
