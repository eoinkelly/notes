# APN

GGSN

- Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN)

APN

- the name of a gateway between a mobile (radio) network (e.g. GSM/3G/4G) and
  another computer network (often the Internet)
- the APN identifies the packet data network (PDN) that a mobile data user wants
  to communicate with
- How it appears in phone settings
    - The APN setting on iPhone has APN, username, password
        - Username and password only required if your carrier requires you to
          supply them to access data
    - Apparently you can also specify an APN type which decides what kind of
      data should go to that APN but I didn't see any such option on iPhones

Anatomy of an APN

```
<NETWORK_ID>.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.gprs
            |<-- operator id ---->|
```

- Network identifier
    - `<NETWORK_ID>` in diagram above
    - required
    - often looks like a domain name associated with the carrier
- operator identifier
    - optional and doesn't seem to be super common in usage
    - `<MNC>`
        - Mobile country code
    - `<MCC>`
        - Mobile network code
    - each carrier has their own unique MCC, MNC pair

LTE has a diff format

    # Old format
    internet.mnc012.mcc345.gprs

    # LTE format (note addition of .apn.epc and replacement of .gprs iwth .3gppnetwork.org
    internet.apn.epc.mnc012.mcc345.3gppnetwork.org

> Your carrier reads these settings in order to generate an IP address, connect
> to the correct secure gateway, and see the carrier needs to connect you to a
> private network like a VPN. All the heavy lifting is done on the carrier side,
> but we need to make sure the right settings are in place to get on the network
> we need, in the way we need to connect.
