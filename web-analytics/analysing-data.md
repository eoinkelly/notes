focus really hard on only reporting metrics that will help 1. increase revenue 2. reduce cost and 3. increase satisfaction. Can’t go wrong with those three

i need to learn about statisctical significance e.g. chi-square, z-test etc. so i can find out how much to trust my GA results




It is easy to measure inputs so the tendency is to manage them (because we can measure them)
but managing outcomes is much more successful even tho outcomes are harder to measure

example inputs
*   num visits to your site

example outcomes
*   num enquiries (sales leads)
*   num actual sales

by focusing on managing the outcome (sales) we can figure out what inputs matter

in GA what does the diff between visits and pageviews in the frequency & recency reports signify

KPI
A key performance indicator (KPI) is a metric that helps you understand how you are doing against your business goals (and objectives).



Segments
What is a segment?
It is a group that is identified by 1) where they came from, 2) what they did on your website and 3) what tasks they accomplished. Think about it in these categories: acquisition, behavior and outcome. Let’s look at each:

Acquisition – Includes everything you do to attract people to your website, like SEO, email, banner ads and PPC marketing.
Behavior – Includes all the activities people perform at your website, like clicking through pages, subscribing to your blog or leaving.
Outcomes – Includes all the activities that are valuable to you and your business, like a purchase or a sign up for your email newsletter.

examples of segments

visitors:
	who came through an organic google search (acquisition)
	and viewed 3 or more pages (behaviour)
	and signed up for our email newsletter (outcomes)

visitors who
	came from anywhere
	did anything on the site (no behaviour segment)
	and signed up for our newsletter

	note that this report is probably less useful as it is less specific


A segment contains a group of people identified by their source (where they came from), behavior (what they did on your website) or outcome (what goals were met).

A segment identifies people or their behavior that is important to your business. Either because you are spending money (paid search advertising, e-mail, etc.) or it causes you to have higher revenues (all people who convert)

All data in aggregate is "crap".
