# General

-   Python objects are open like OpenStruct in ruby
-   Python lets you grab "method objects" from classes and use them anywhere python expects a "callable"
-   dir() shows you all the "attributes" in an object
-   You can make lambdas with `lambda:`
-   python can implement ruby' `method_missing` by overriding both of `__getattr__` and `__setattr__`
-   `__getattr__` is what python calls on an object to get its attribute
