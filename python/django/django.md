# Django

- Django project contains many Django apps
    - each app is a python package (a directory with an `__init__.py`)
    - apps can live anywhere on your `PYTHONPATH`
- has a local dev server
- prod servers can be `ASGI` or `WSGI` convention
    - What servers are used in prod?
- Includes authentication and authorization (built-in devise and pundit)
- Current latest is 5.0.2
- organised by sub-apps
    - `runserver` seems to look for at all the python packages (folders with
      `__init__.py` ) in cwd and run them
    - there is a "core" django app (aka python package) created with same name
      as project
        - it does not have migrations sub dir unlike other sub apps - why?
            - those migration files seem to be built-in to the django package.
              The `django_migrations` table does track their application
        - the name of the project and core package (which are same) is
          hard-coded into files in the core package
        - the app has the followign modules
            1. settings
            1. urls
            1. wsgi
            1. asgi
- urls are routed to "Views" via the `urls` python module in each app
    - django views seem to act like rails controllers a bit
- the inital django migration creates tables for
    - auth (users, groups, permissions)
    - sessions
        - TODO: sessions are tracked in DB by default?
    - applied migrations
    - MIME content types
    - admin log
        - stores an audit log of actions taken by admins
- no user is automatically created
- Built-in authentication and authorisation
    - `/admin` is the URL for user sign-in
        - gives you a basic "rails admin" style admin
        - you can manage users and groups out of the box
    - how to set default password constraints for auth?
        - they don't seem super strong by default???
- https://www.pyinvoke.org/ seems to be the Python rake
    - not included in the default django install but is in our work one
- django doesn't create any package management files by default
    - you install the packages however you want and then edit `INSTALLED_APPS`
      in settings to tell Django about it.
- https://django-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
    - fills in some tools I miss from Rails e.g. `show_urls`
- views
    - most of the logic in an app is defined in views
    - view can be a function or a class
    - gets a `HttpRequest` instance and returns a `HttpResponse` instance
- templates
    - django has it's own Django Template Language (DTL) but also ships with
      Jinja2 support
    - we seem to use [jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) with
      `.html` file extensions
- jinja2 https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/
    - has for loops, if/else, macros, can set variables
- migrations
    - are built automatically from your models via `makemigrations` command.
      `migrate` command applies the migrations
- apps
    - all the models, views, templates required by the app
    - an app is a single design domain in DDD
    - book says you should be able to move the app to another project if well
      designed - is that realistic?

## manage.py

- gives access to various commands
- contains all the commands that `django-admin` provides and more

#

$ python manage.py shell # rails console equivalent
$ python manage.py test # run tests
```

- Has a `squashmigrations` command which seems cool addition

## default routes from fresh django app

‚ùØ python manage.py show_urls

## Running django in production

- Usually deployed behind a reverse proxy like nginx
- [gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) seems popular
    - a python re-implementation of Unicorn in Ruby

## async django

- https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/async/
    - seems like there are some constraints
        - all middleware you use must support async too
        - there doesn't seem to be full support for the ORM
        - it seems there is some disagreement in the community about how async
          django can become
        - https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/discussions/7774#discussioncomment-6361530
          seems like a good summary from July 2023
- Async seems to be done by using https://www.uvicorn.org/ as a worker type
  within https://gunicorn.org/
- We seem to mostly just use async unicorn at work but there is support for
  async in the template and poetry file
- Async seems to be required for websockets
