## with statements

The Python with statement creates a runtime context that allows you to run a
group of statements under the control of a context manager.

The context manager object results from evaluating the expression after with. In
other words, expression must return an object that implements the context
management protocol. This protocol consists of two special methods:

    .__enter__() is called by the with statement to enter the runtime context.
    .__exit__() is called when the execution leaves the with code block.


# Misc unsorted

* `(a, b, c)` creates a tuple in python (tuples are immutable, value objects, efficent because they aren't copied around)
* `[a, b, c]` creates a list in python (lists are mutable)


```python
import numpy as np

# it seems tuples and lists can be used interchangeably to pass args to numpy functions
np.matrix( ((1,2), (3,4)) ) # notice this is a tuple of tuples (np.array expects one arg)
np.array([[100,175,210],[90,160,150],[200,50,100],[120,0,310]]) # notice this is a list of lists (np.array expects one arg)

```

```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> x = np.array([1,2])
>>> y = np.array([2,4])
>>> x + y
array([3, 6])

>>> 2 * x
array([2, 4])

>>> np.dot(x,y)
10

>>> x * y
array([2, 8])

>>> type(x)
<class 'numpy.ndarray'>

>>> type(x * y)
<class 'numpy.ndarray'>

>>> a = np.array(2,3) # elemetns must be grouped in arg
