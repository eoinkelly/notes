# My learning notes

I have put these on github as a backup and also because it makes it easy to
share parts of these with others. That being said, these notes are not designed
for use by anybody other than me so YMMV on readability and even accuracy.

- It is ok for these notes to be messy/wrong. Building them up is an iterative
  process and there is as much value in re-reading and improving them as
  creating the initial draft.
- I commit to finishing a chapter, not a book. I try to remain nimble about the
  depth I learn a particular topic. To commit to a whole book lets the author
  decide on the depth that might not be a good investment of time for me.
- I organise notes by topic, not by source. These notes are for
    1. Revising what I have learned
    2. Express what I have learned to help me find holes in my understanding

- I try to do a _breadth first_ traversal of topics. I try to mark any
  questions/todos that come up and not follow them too deeply because:
    1. It is not always clear how much depth I need to go in a topic.
    2. I would never get anything finished!
