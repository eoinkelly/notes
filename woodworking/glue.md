## Things to look for in a glue

1. What kinds of surface can it stick to and which is it best on
    - examples
        - wood
        - metal
        - plastic
        - glass
        - etc.
    - What kind of roughing up of the surfaces above makes it adhere best
1. how strong is the initial tack (how sticky does it get quickly)
1. how quick is the initial tack?
1. How long is the open time - how long does it remain loose enough to work
   with, get clamps in place etc.
1. How long does it take to fully cure to full strength
1. What is it's solvent?
    - water?
        - water will make wood fibres swell
    - something else?
1. What kinds of finish can be applied to it well?
    - can it be sanded?
    - can it be buffed and polished like other finishes?
1. How does it react with other finishes and glues?
    - will it melt finish?
    - Will any finishes or chemicals prevent it from curing properly
1. Will it stick to itself well e.g. adding new glue on old glued joint
    - hide glue good for this apparently
1. What consistency does it dry to
    - rubbery
    - brittle and glassy and hard
        - might transmit sound well but be less flexible?
    - sticky goop (more flexible, harder to clean off)
1. What colours is it available in?
1. Are there accelerators available for it?
1. How long is the shelf life?
1. How resistant is it to heat and humidity and cold?
    - sometimes you want it to resist, sometimes not for repairability e.g. guitar necks
1. What substances required to do cleanup?
    - examples
        - water
        - acetone
        - mineral turps
1. What viscosity is it?
1. How toxic to humans is it?
1. Is it safe for indirect or direct contact with food?
1. Is it designed for exterior or interior use?
    1. How does it react to UV? will it degrade or change colour over time?
1. What temp range can you work with it within?
1. Can it be thinned if necessary? If so, thinned with what? (presumably
   whatever its medium already is)
1. What is the pH of the glue? What will it do to the surfaces long-term
    - In particular, low pH can impact metal surfaces
1. How much clamping pressure needed?
1. Wood specific
    - which species does it work well with?
    - What about woods that are very oily?
    - Does it work on MDF or plywood?
1. How water resistant is it?
1. Will it stain the materials it sticks to or gets close to?
1. Does it shrink or expand as it cures?
    - e.g. Polyurethane glues expand as they cure which can be good - make joint
      tighter
      - > On a properly made joint, the shrinkage (of alphatic glues like Titebond) actually pulls the joint tighter.
1. How does it go on materials that have high moisture content e.g. fresher
   wood?
1. Will the joint keep moving under pressure after cure? aka does it creep
1. Is it resistant to mold and fungus?
1. How resistant to abrasion is it?
1. How flammable is it in storage, in use, and once cured?
1. What finishes can you put on it? e.g. will it absorb a wood stain?
1. how good at filling gaps is it?
    > Several wood glues have poor "gap-filling" ability, meaning they either
    > soak into the wood and leave the gap empty, or remain to fill the gap but
    > have little structural integrity.
1. What is the mechanism of curing?
    - exposure to water?
    - exposure to air?
    - something else?
1. Does it dry clear or opaque? If opaque, what color does it dry?
1. How reversible is the repair using this glue?

## Questions

- are some glues designed to be on one side only or two sides?
    - are there some times you could do either e.g. glueing sufaces that absorb
      a lot e.g. end grain

## Asides

- Composite wood products may already have glue in them
    - Sometimes this contains formaldehyde but this is less common these days

### Aside: Viscosity

- to measure it, we basically quantify how much force is needed to make a fluid
  move at a certain rate.
- remember that viscosity values are very temperature sensitive - the number
  will be for a specific temp
- expressed in pascal-seconds (Pa·s) or the older centipoise (cP) unit, where 1
  cP = 0.001 Pa·s

list showing dynamic viscosity values (in centipoise, cP) for some familiar
fluids, all measured around 20 °C (room temperature):

| Fluid                  | Approx. Viscosity (cP) | Notes                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Air                    | 0.018                  | Extremely low — gases have very little internal friction.                         |
| Water                  | 1.0                    | The benchmark; many viscosities are compared to water.                            |
| Ethanol                | 1.2                    | Slightly thicker than water.                                                      |
| Olive oil              | 80–100                 | Flows easily but noticeably thicker than water.                                   |
| Motor oil (SAE 10W-30) | 100–150                | Depends strongly on temperature; gets much thicker when cold.                     |
| Glycerin               | 1,000–1,500            | Thick and syrupy; often used as a calibration fluid.                              |
| Honey                  | 2,000–10,000           | Varies with brand, sugar content, and temperature.                                |
| Ketchup                | ~50,000                | Non-Newtonian: thins when you shake or squeeze it.                                |
| Peanut butter          | ~250,000               | Essentially a paste; not really a fluid in everyday flow terms.                   |
| Pitch (tar)            | billions               | So viscous it takes years to drip — famously used in the “pitch-drop” experiment. |

For context: 1 Pa·s = 1 000 cP. So water’s viscosity is about 0.001 Pa·s, while
honey might be 5–10 Pa·s.

Temperature makes a big difference. Heating a liquid by just 10 °C can cut its
viscosity by half or more; this is why cold oil feels sluggish and warm syrup
pours easily.

## Polyurethane glue

- Polyurethane glue (trade names include Gorilla Glue and Excel)

> It bonds to textile fibers, metals, plastics, glass, sand, ceramics and
> rubber, in addition to wood. Polyurethane wood adhesives are normally
> prepolymers terminated with isocyanate groups. When exposed to moisture,
> isocyanates react with water and thus cure the adhesives. Therefore,
> one-component polyurethane adhesives are also named as moisture-cure
> polyurethanes. In addition, interactions between polyurethanes and wood
> polymers can significantly influence bond performance.[23] Polyurethane glues
> expand when they cure, improving adhesion where the fit is not tight. Unlike
> PVA glues, they can be used to glue end grains.

## Hot Hide glue

- based on collagen from animal hides and hooves
- gets gooey when wet and hot but dries hard and brittle
- chemically similar to edible gelatin
- non-toxic if ingested
- very traditional in instrument making
- pros/cons
    - pro: will soften with heat
    - con: short open time - around ???
    - con: bit fiddly to use - you need water bath to heat it up and keep it hot
- sometimes has additives added
    - TODO: find out more
- Hide glue does not creep.
- Hide glue joints are easy to repair, by just heating and adding more hide
  glue.
- Sticks well to itself

- Hide glue is measured on the basis of its "gel strength",
    - a measure of how many grams of force it requires to depress a 1⁄2 in (13
      mm) plunger 4 mm (0.16 in) into a 12.5% protein solution of the glue at 10
      °C (50 °F).

> Glue is manufactured in standard grades from 32–512 grams (1.1–18.1 oz).

- 135-gram (4.8 oz)
    - the lowest used for general woodwork
- 192-gram (6.8 oz) strength
    - most commonly used for woodworking
- 251-gram (8.9 oz)
    - the highest normally used for instrument building
- above 250-gram (8.8 oz) strength
    - requires excessive dilution and so leaves too little glue in joints for
      effective adhesion, so it is not commonly used.

I guess you choose your own dilution level with hide glue? Does it matter what
you pick (other than time required to cure it and the impact that more water
might have on the joint?)

### Liquid hide glue

- Had additive (usually urea) to keep it liquid at room temperature and extend
  drying time
- Examples:
    - Old Brown Glue
    - Titebond Liquid Hide.

## Fish glue

- similar properties to hide glue
- pro: longer open time than hide glue

## regular wood glue?

## PVA Polyvinyl acetate

- aka "white woodworking glue"
- not as strong or as waterproof as aliphatic glues (TODO: verify this)

> Polyvinyl acetate (PVA), also known as "white glue", "hobby and craft" or
> “school glue” is non toxic, PH neutral, inexpensive, and easy to use, and is
> therefore the most commonly used type of wood glue. Joints should be tight
> fitting and clamped during curing for maximum strength. PVAs remain flexible
> after they have cured, however, and will creep under constant load. Joints
> that were previously glued with PVA may be hard to repair since most glues
> (including PVA itself) do not adhere well to cured PVA glue. PVA glues are not
> waterproof, however type 2 PVAs are water resistant.

## Aliphatic glue

- a class of woodworking adhesive
- often called "yellow wood glue" because it has a butter yellow colour in
  contrast to "white" PVA glue
- a synthetic resin
- water based
- cleanup with soap and water

> Aliphatic resin glue is chemically similar to PVA (white glue), but it is
> chemically modified to make it stronger and more waterproof. It is typically a
> buttery yellow color and is sold as "carpenter’s wood glue." A major brand
> name in the US is "TiteBond." It should be available in most major hardware
> stores, as it is completely ubiquitous here in the States. It takes about
> 15-30 minutes to dry and it sands reasonably well, although it does sometimes
> gum-up the sandpaper if you use too much. Like PVA, it's very inexpensive.

## Casein glue

- Made from milk
- Susceptible to mold and fungus
- Not super common these days

## Epoxy resin

- available as glue or putty

> Epoxy resin, usually as a two-part mix system, cures under a wider range of
> temperatures and moisture content than other glues, does not require pressure
> while curing, and has good gap-filling properties: near-perfect joints with
> very small gaps actually produce weaker bonds.

## Cyanoacrylate aka Superglue

> Cyanoacrylate (Crazy glue, Superglue, CA or CyA) is used mainly for small
> repairs, especially by woodturners. It bonds instantly, including to skin.
> Cured CA is essentially a plastic material

> Versions are available that are able to wick into tight joints but bond with
> reduced strength (because much drips out and much soaks into the wood leaving
> very little on the surface for the bond), or thicker formulations (gel) which
> can fill very small gaps, do not flow out of the joint, and do not soak so
> quickly into wood. Thinner cyanoacrylate glue does not bond more quickly nor
> form shorter polymer chains than the gel version when used on wood. The
> chemical nature of wood significantly delays polymerization of cyanoacrylate.
> When it finally polymerizes in a wood joint, enough gel remains for a better
> bond than with the thin version. When using the gel, too much glue will weaken
> the resulting bond. Likewise, applying too little of the thin super glue will
> result in almost no glue at all remaining in a wood joint, causing a weak bond
> or no bond at all. Versions are also available that are foam safe (regular CA
> dissolves most plastic foams) which are usually also marketed as low odor.
> Cyanoacrylate is stiff but has a low shear strength (brittle) thus normal wood
> bending can break the bond in some applications. Often, too much adhesive is
> applied which leads to a much weaker bond. CA has quickly become the dominant
> adhesive used by builders of balsa wood models, where its strength far exceeds
> the base materials.

- comes in different viscosities for different uses
- uses
    - can just be dripped on to fill small gaps
        - ?? I presume because when you scrape it and sand it down it looks like
          typical wood finishes
    - fill bigger gaps by mixed with wood dust to fill gaps in wood
- thinner glue will flow into joints but will also soak into wood more so can
  make a weaker bond than something that sits on top more
    - too little thin glue will make a weaker bond because so much soaks in
    - too much of the gel glue will make a weaker bond because
- sometimes you want it to flow, sometimes you want more of a gel

### Cyanoacrylate vs epoxy resin

- When cyano better than epoxy
    - less temperature sensitive
    - available in more viscosities
    - easy to remove with acetone **after** curing (epoxy is very difficult to remove once cured)
    - faster cure time vs epoxy
    - epoxy doesn't work with many very common kinds of plastic (PET, PP)
- When epoxy is better
    - when you need gap filling (superglues are strongest with a very thin join layer)
    - when the joint needs to be more flexible - cyanoacrylate is brittle when cured and subject to stress cracking
    - cyanos have poor peel strength
    - cyanos have poor solvent resistance
    - cyanos have poor adherence to glass
    - creates a structural bond that can endure stress - cyanos require a thin
      bond line

## Silicone based

- I think Liquid Nails is this

## Misc

- glueing end grain is not recommended but apparently can actually can be pretty strong in many cases

## Double glue technique

1. Apply glue to both sides of joint and let it dry
    - this allows the glue to soak into the wood fibres (especially good for end grain)
2. Apply a second layer of glue to one side and stick the sides together
    - The solvents in the new glue will dissolve the old glue

I presume the idea is that the initial glue creates a proper connection between
the wood and the glue itself, by letting the glue soak in. Then the second glue
just connects the sides. Overall this is a better joint than a single glue

It depends on the glue being good at sticking to itself - whatever solvent it
uses should dissolve the old glue.
