# Binding and purfling


## Binding

- Celluloid
    - usually some kind of plastic
    - can be made from
        - con: highly flammable, tricky/expensive to ship
        - used in old instruments
        - eventually rots
            - why?
                - I _think_ it's the things added to it to make it more elastic that off-gas? or is it off-gassing of something else in the guitar?


## Purfling

- thin strips of laminate wood glued together to make a decorative design
- strips can be wood but can be other materials e.g. man-made fibre based plastic things
