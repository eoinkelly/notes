# Finishes


1. Oils
Natural oils like linseed, tung, and Danish oil soak into the wood and harden within the grain. They enrich color and emphasize texture, giving a “hand-rubbed” warmth. They’re easy to refresh but offer limited surface protection against heat and water.

2. Waxes
Usually beeswax or carnauba blended with solvents, waxes produce a soft sheen and smooth feel. They’re often used over oils or shellac for added luster. Easy to apply but easily marred—best for low-wear pieces like furniture or paneling.

3. Shellac
A natural resin dissolved in alcohol, shellac builds a glossy, amber-tinted surface that dries fast and buffs beautifully. It’s traditional, repairable, and biodegradable—but vulnerable to alcohol, heat, and water.

4. Lacquer
Modern lacquers (nitrocellulose or acrylic) are sprayed on for a very smooth, hard finish. They dry quickly, polish well, and are widely used in furniture and musical instruments. Downsides: toxic fumes, flammability, and poor moisture resistance unless catalyzed.

5. Varnish
A durable blend of resins, oils, and solvents that forms a thick, protective film. Polyurethane varnish dominates today—resistant to abrasion, heat, and chemicals. It’s tougher but more plasticky in feel and harder to repair than oils or shellac.

6. Water-based Polyurethanes and Acrylics
These have largely replaced solvent-based finishes for indoor use. They’re clear, low-odor, and fast-drying, with good durability and less yellowing. However, they can raise the grain and feel slightly colder or “thinner” than oil-based counterparts.

7. Stains and Dyes
Not finishes by themselves but coloring agents. Stains combine pigments with binders to highlight grain; dyes penetrate more deeply and evenly. Usually followed by a protective topcoat.

8. Penetrating Sealers and Hybrid Finishes
Modern blends—like Danish oil-varnish mixes or “hardwax oils”—aim to combine the depth of an oil with the toughness of varnish. They’re popular in flooring for a natural matte look with decent durability.

Each finish balances three factors:

1. appearance,
2. protection
3. maintainability

- Oils and waxes favor beauty and easy repair;
- varnishes and polyurethanes favor longevity;
- lacquers and shellac sit in between, elegant but delicate.



### Oils

⸻

Linseed Oil (Raw or Boiled)

Pros
	•	Deeply penetrates wood and enhances the grain with a warm amber tone.
	•	Readily available and inexpensive.
	•	Easy to reapply and repair small scratches.

Cons
	•	Raw linseed oil dries painfully slowly (can take days to weeks).
	•	“Boiled” linseed oil isn’t actually boiled—it’s chemically modified and often contains metallic drying agents.
	•	Offers minimal water and heat resistance.
	•	Can darken wood over time and attract mildew in damp environments.

Typical use: Traditional furniture, tool handles, and heritage restorations.

⸻

Tung Oil (Pure or Polymerized)

Pros
	•	Cures to a hard, water-resistant film inside the wood fibers.
	•	Produces a rich, slightly matte finish that doesn’t darken much over time.
	•	Food-safe when fully cured (used on cutting boards and utensils).

Cons
	•	Pure tung oil dries slowly and requires multiple thin coats with long intervals.
	•	Expensive compared to linseed oil.
	•	Must be applied meticulously—thick coats remain tacky.

Typical use: Fine furniture, musical instruments, kitchenware.

⸻

Danish Oil (Blend of Oil, Varnish, and Solvent)

Pros
	•	Combines penetration (oil) with durability (varnish).
	•	Easier and faster to apply than pure oils.
	•	Builds a slight sheen and offers better moisture resistance.

Cons
	•	Quality varies widely by brand—some are mostly varnish, others mostly oil.
	•	Not easily repairable once polymerized like a varnish layer.
	•	Lacks the “natural” purity of tung or linseed.

Typical use: Furniture, cabinetry, and decorative indoor pieces.

⸻

Teak Oil (Marketing Term, Usually a Blend)

Pros
	•	Designed for dense, oily woods like teak, mahogany, and iroko.
	•	Penetrates better into those species than most oils.
	•	Can enhance color and offer some UV protection (depending on additives).

Cons
	•	“Teak oil” isn’t a specific formula—it’s a vague commercial blend (often linseed + varnish + solvents).
	•	Requires frequent reapplication outdoors.
	•	Offers limited long-term protection versus marine varnish.

Typical use: Outdoor furniture, boats, garden benches.

⸻

Mineral Oil

Pros
	•	Completely non-toxic and odorless.
	•	Very easy to apply and maintain.
	•	Ideal for food-contact surfaces.

Cons
	•	Never hardens—remains oily and must be reapplied regularly.
	•	Provides almost no water or abrasion resistance.
	•	Attracts dust and fingerprints easily.

Typical use: Chopping boards, butcher blocks, and wooden utensils.

⸻

Hardwax Oil (Modern Hybrid)

Pros
	•	Blend of natural oils (often linseed or tung) and waxes.
	•	Produces a matte, natural finish that resists water and wear better than traditional oils.
	•	Easy to spot-repair and doesn’t peel or crack.

Cons
	•	More expensive than conventional oils.
	•	Slightly less protective than full polyurethane varnish.
	•	Some brands vary in hardness and gloss.

Typical use: Flooring, furniture, high-touch surfaces.

⸻

If you imagine a spectrum from “natural feel” to “maximum protection”, it runs roughly like this:
Mineral → Linseed → Tung → Danish → Hardwax → Varnish.

For indoor furniture, tung or Danish oil usually hit the sweet spot. For floors, hardwax oils win. For anything food-related, mineral oil reigns supreme.

#### Oils on fretboards

Unfinished boards e.g. rosewood, ebony etc.

Guitar "lemon oil" is just lemon scented mineral oil.
Oils ok to use on fretboards:
- "boiled" linseed oil
- mineral oil
- "guitar lemon oil" which is just lemon scented mineral oil
- Other ingredients found in specialized fretboard conditioners include natural seed and tree oils, and vitamin E to stabilize the mixture.

## Shellac

It’s a natural resin secreted by the lac bug (Kerria lacca), a tiny insect native to India and Southeast Asia. The bugs feed on tree sap—usually from fig or acacia species—and leave behind a resinous coating on the branches. Harvesters scrape this resin, purify it, and dry it into brittle flakes.

When those flakes are dissolved in ethyl alcohol, you get liquid shellac—a finish that has been used for centuries on furniture, instruments, and even as a food glaze (it’s what makes some candies shiny).

⸻

How It Works

When brushed or sprayed on wood, shellac’s alcohol base evaporates quickly, leaving behind a thin, hard film of natural resin. It bonds well to nearly any surface and creates a lustrous, amber-toned finish that enhances the depth of the wood grain. Because it’s thermoplastic (it softens under heat or alcohol), each new coat melts into the last—making repairs easy.

⸻

Pros
	•	Fast-drying: Touch-dry in minutes; several coats can be applied in a day.
	•	Beautiful glow: Adds warmth and chatoyance (that subtle shimmer of depth).
	•	Repairable: Can be dissolved or reblended easily for touch-ups.
	•	Natural and non-toxic: Once cured, it’s food-safe—used on baby toys, guitars, and even pills.
	•	Excellent sealer: Often used as a barrier coat under other finishes or to block stains and odors.

⸻

Cons
	•	Not water-resistant: White rings appear when exposed to moisture.
	•	Heat-sensitive: Can soften or cloud under hot cups or sun exposure.
	•	Limited durability: Scratches and wears more easily than varnish or polyurethane.
	•	Shelf life: Liquid shellac spoils after about a year, so it’s best mixed fresh from flakes.

⸻

Common Uses
	•	Fine furniture: French polishing—a hand-rubbed shellac technique—is the gold standard for antiques and high-end instruments.
	•	Musical instruments: Especially guitars, violins, and pianos for their resonant, glossy finish.
	•	Sealer coat: Under lacquer or polyurethane, it locks in sap, odors, or dye bleed.

⸻

In essence, shellac is the predecessor of modern finishes—organic chemistry’s gift from the pre-industrial world. It’s still unmatched for clarity, warmth, and repairability, though less suited for daily abuse or moisture.
