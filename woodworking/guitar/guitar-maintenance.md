- Measure in playing position (gravity matters)
- To measure: Put capo on first, press last fret with your finger and measure at
  the 8th fret
- At 8th fret, string height (top of **fret** to bottom of string) should be
  0.1 - 0.3 mm

- Before measuring
    - Ensure instrument tuned to your desired tuning (this matters)
    - String height should escalate from the treble to the bass side
    - Measure in playing position (gravity matters)
- US guitars
    - 1st fret
        - Treble side: 0.4 - 0.6 mm

# Misc

I need a ruler that goes to 10th of a mm

?? Given all this stuff is american, are inches the defacto standard? Recommend
a machinst ruler in 1/32 and 1/64 of inches

Tools I want to have

1. Better small snips (? I already have a snips but it's not great)
2. String action ruler gauge tool
    1. need small increments (down to 1/64th of an inch)
    2. needs to start flush at edge
3. Understring radius guage set
4. String radius gauge (square thingy) with notches cut out for the strings

?? maybe a little pick to get gunk out from under the frets - some sort of
dentist tool some sort of soft towel mat a neck holder - could be wood or
stuffed fabric some small allen keys to adjust intonation etc.

Don't use oil or solvents on a maple neck - it's fine to use on rosewood

Tools I have

1. Long straight ruler (can use Amelia's)

Guitar care products

- MUSIC NOMAD TUNE-IT - NUT AND SADDLE LUBRICANT (Rockshop has it)

The order to do things when setting up a guitar:

    TRAIN

1. Tune it up
1. Relief (adjust truss rod)
1. Action
1. Intonation
1. Noodle (play it a bit)

## Shop checklist

1. Check for fret sprout
    - run hand down the edge of the fret to check if any fret wire sticking out
      because the neck shrunk
1. Check for edge of fret board roundness - a bit rounder is better because it
   feels more "played in"
1. String spacing: Check for distance between the high/low E and edge of
   fretboard
    - vintage guitar bridges tend to be wider so have strings closer to the edge
        - ?? gives a diff feel playing it
    - close to the edge can be bad if your string falls off during vibrato
1. Check nut height
    - finger third fret then check height of string over the first fret - it
      should be very low
1. Check neck relief
    - hold down first fret and last fret with pinky then use other index finger
      to tap around 12th fret to see how much string height above the fret (uses
      string as a straight edge)
    - compare the heights on the high and low E sides - they should be similar -
      if they are not the neck could be wonky
1. Check for sticky neck - sometimes the finish can make back sticky when it
   gets hot
    - can be fixed by waxing it or sanding off the finish
1. Check neck shape
    - just personal prefernce
1. Next edge rolled or sharp
    - rolled edge feels more played in and can feel nicer
1. Neck friction
    - looking for friction free back of neck
    - how fast/easily can you move up and down
1. Weight
    - very heavy could be a problem (uncomfortable) as could very light (? thin
      tone)
1. Woods
    - what woods involved?
    - how many pieces in body?
    - how many pieces in neck?
1. Check electronics
    - make sure all the switches work and stay in position and change sound as
      you would expect
    - make sure knobs actually work, notice their smoothness or not
1. Check tuners
    - Check stats: ratio (higher = better)
    - smoothness
    - how easily you can find and keep the right spot
    - sometimes brand can be useful to know but often muddy
1. Bridge
    - saddles
1. Tailpiece (if there is one)
1. Tremelo system (if there is one)
1. Board radius
    - Try a bend high up on the neck - see if it chokes off when you bend a lot
    - flatter boards can have lower action because strings don't choke out
    - "fretting out" - the fretboard is curved so if you bend far the string can
      lose contact with the top of the fret
    - fretboard radius will matter here but all these matter too:
        - fret level
        - string height
        - neck relief
1. Pickups
    - ?? pickup height
1. What are the frets made of
    - Stainless steel
        - is modern and considered very good
        - Gibson & Fender don't default to stainless steel yet. Why?
        - ++ they outlast nickel frets by a lot
            - re-frets are expensive if you have a finish on your fretboard or
              have binding
        - -- more expensive
    - Nickel-silver alloy (usually contain zinc)
        - has been the default for years
        - contains no actual silver
        - there are different levels of nickel-silver hardness - frets can vary
        - Luthier tools tend to support it better
1. What type fret wire
    - three main types (there are some sizes in between these)
        1. Vintage (smallest)
            - tend to have necks which are quite rounded over
        2. Medium-Jumbo
            - also called Medium
        3. Jumbo
            - ++ you don't have to push down very much to make the note
            - -- your hand might get bit raw from running along the edge of the
              frets because they are tall
        4. Extra jumbo
            - my Snakebyte has this

what are string trees for?

## Cleaning a rosewood fretboard

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoTFuLYSB7c

mask off with low tac tape use 4-0 wire wool to polish with "wood oil soap" go
up and down the fretboard with the grain with the wool not across the grain

put lemon oil on at the end to protect if wire wool fibres get in pickups they
can ruin them so be careful to mask
