# Plastics

- Knowing what kind of plastic a thing is can be important for glueing it e.g. Selleys ardalite will bond
most plastics* but will not bond Polyethylene or Polypropylene plastics.

Plastics are polymers—long chains of repeating molecular units—engineered to be flexible, strong, or resistant depending on their composition. Their variety comes from how the polymer chains are arranged, cross-linked, and modified with additives. Here’s a practical breakdown of the major types in everyday use:

Categories

1. Thermoplastics
    - PE
1. Thermosetting plastics
1. Elastomers (Rubber like polymers


## Thermoplastics

These soften when heated and harden when cooled, making them recyclable and easy to mold repeatedly.

•	Polyethylene (PE): The most common plastic. Low-density (LDPE) makes squeeze bottles and plastic bags; high-density (HDPE) makes milk jugs and pipes. Tough, waxy, and chemically resistant.
•	Polypropylene (PP): Used for food containers, car parts, and textiles. It resists fatigue—hinges and snap-lids rely on it.
•	Polyvinyl chloride (PVC): Rigid in pipes, flexible in cables and flooring when plasticized. Its chlorine content makes it flame resistant but less environmentally friendly.
•	Polystyrene (PS): Found in disposable cutlery, packaging foam, and CD cases. Brittle but easily molded; expanded PS (Styrofoam) insulates well.
•	Polyethylene terephthalate (PET): Used in drink bottles and synthetic fabrics (polyester). Strong, transparent, and recyclable.
    -
•	Acrylic (PMMA): Glass substitute (Plexiglas). Clear, glossy, and more shatter-resistant than glass.
•	Polycarbonate (PC): Extremely strong and clear—used for safety goggles and optical discs. However, it can release bisphenol-A (BPA) if not formulated properly.
•	Nylon (Polyamide): Used in textiles, gears, and ropes; strong, abrasion-resistant, but absorbs water.

## Thermosetting plastics

These cure irreversibly into rigid networks—once set, they don’t melt.
•	Epoxy resins: Used in coatings, adhesives, and composites (like carbon fiber). Durable and chemically resistant.
•	Phenolic resins (Bakelite): Early plastic, used in electrical fittings and cookware handles for heat resistance.
•	Melamine formaldehyde: Common in laminates and kitchenware. Hard, glossy, heat-tolerant.
•	Urea formaldehyde: Used in electrical casings and adhesives; hard and inexpensive.

## Elastomers (Rubber-like polymers)

They stretch and return to shape.
•	Silicone rubber: Heat-resistant, inert, and used in cookware, seals, and medical devices.
•	Polyurethane (PU): Range from soft foams in cushions to tough coatings and wheels.
•	Natural and synthetic rubbers (like SBR): Used in tires, seals, and footwear.

## Recycling in NZ

Plastics accepted in kerbside recycling:

Number 1 (PET): Common in soft drink, water, and juice bottles.
Number 2 (HDPE): Found in milk bottles, detergent, and shampoo bottles.
Number 5 (PP): Often used for containers like margarine, yoghurt, and some takeaway containers.

Plastics generally not accepted in kerbside recycling:

Number 3 (PVC): Cannot be recycled in New Zealand and should go in the rubbish.
Number 4 (LDPE): Markets are limited for this type of plastic.
Number 6 (PS): Includes polystyrene and is not easily recycled in kerbside bins.
Number 7 (Other): This category includes various mixtures of plastics and other materials, and is generally not accepted.

### PCTG (a common form of durable PET)

Used in my water bottle

PCTG stands for polycyclohexylene dimethylene terephthalate glycol-modified, a mouthful that essentially means it’s a modified copolyester—a close chemical cousin of PET (polyethylene terephthalate). It belongs to the same family as PETG, but with a tweak in its structure that makes it even tougher and more heat-resistant.

Here’s what defines it:
•	Type: Amorphous copolyester (thermoplastic)
•	Family: PET derivatives (specifically, a glycol-modified copolymer)
•	Common brand names: Eastman PCTG Copolyester, SK Ecozen, etc.

Properties:
•	High clarity and gloss—optically clear like glass.
•	Excellent toughness and impact resistance (stronger than PETG).
•	Good chemical resistance, especially to alcohols and cleaning agents.
•	Easy to thermoform and injection-mold.
•	Higher heat deflection temperature than PETG (it holds shape better near boiling water).
•	BPA-free and food-safe—popular in reusable bottles, blender jars, and medical parts.

Typical uses:
•	Reusable drinkware and water bottles
•	Cosmetic containers
•	Medical and laboratory equipment
•	Appliance parts (especially clear ones)
•	Protective housings for electronics or tools

In short, PCTG is a clear, durable, and food-safe copolyester, used when you need something with PETG’s clarity but better impact and thermal resistance. It’s recyclable in the same stream as PET (#1), though many municipal systems don’t explicitly recognize it yet, so it often ends up being down-cycled or treated as general thermoplastic waste.
