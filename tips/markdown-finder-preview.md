I installed http://inkmarkapp.com/markdown-quick-look-plugin-mac-os-x/ and then manually deleted /Library/QuickLook/QLMarkdown.qlgenerator (thinking that would uninstall it) but it must have changed something else in the system because now I can view markdown files as plaintext in the finder which is what i wanted all along :-)
