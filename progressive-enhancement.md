# What is a definition of progressive enhancement for JS app developers?

It is _not_ working with JS disabled. is it about picking a baseline that
includes JS ???

# What are the ways that PE is the same for both JS apps and web pages?

- HTML element support
    - polyfill as required

- CSS
    - App should work if CSS does not load or is disabled.
    - App should not break if ??? CSS features are not present

# What would the differences be between a fully PE compliant(TM) Ember app and a standard one?

During first load ...

- Must handle being offline/unable to communicate with the server
    - would have to cache all data locally, replay any changes on server when we
      get back online
    - seems manageable
    - probably something we have to do anyway

- Must handle JS not being available/turned off
    - start by delivering a server rendered start page and then boot the JS
    - if JS boot fails fall back to a server (HTML+CSS only) flow
    - this is a huge amount of work!
    - ? is this basically having 2 apps?
    - the user might enter your app on any page so has to work for all
        - probably not too hard given the boot process would be the same in all
          cases ???

- Must handle JS being there but slow
    - ???

- Must handle JS missing features
    - define a minimum set of features required
    - ? or define a set of supported browsers
    - polyfill as required

- Must handle some/all images not displaying
    - always add alt tags to content images
    - request appropriately sized image (JS could help here, otherwise default)

- Must work for screen-readers
