## Math

Yegge reckons basic discrete math is important

## Algorithms

- Introduction to Algorithms (MIT Course
    - MIT OCW:
      http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-design-and-analysis-of-algorithms-spring-2015/
    - Book: https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms
    - is available free with video lectures erc.
    - longer than the Algorithm design manual
    - Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein, otherwise known as CLRS
- The Algorithm Design Manual
    - http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1849967202
    - shorter, concise, covers some data structures

Yegge really rates graphs as a tool

> Whenever someone gives you a problem, think graphs. They are the most
> fundamental and flexible way of representing any kind of a relationship, so
> it's about a 50-50 shot that any interesting design problem has a graph
> involved in it. Make absolutely sure you can't think of a way to solve it
> using graphs before moving on to other solution types.

- Algorithm complexity
- Sorting
- Graphs
- Hash tables
- Trees

Be able to recognise NP-complete problems such as

- Travelling salesman
- Knapsack

even when asked about them in the guise of a different problem

which also recommends the MIT algorithms book:

> So stop trying to memorize everything. Instead, start with the basics and
> learn to do two things:
>
> Visualize the data structure. Intuitively understand what the data structure
> looks like, what it feels like to use it, and how it is structured both in the
> abstract and physically in your computer’s memory. This is the single most
> important thing you can do, and it is useful from the simplest queues and
> stacks up through the most complicated self-balancing tree. Draw it, visualize
> it in your head, whatever you need to do: Understand the structure
> intuitively.
>
> Learn when and how to use different data structures and their algorithms in
> your own code. This is harder as a student, as the problem assignments you’ll
> work through just won’t impart this knowledge. That’s fine. Realize you won’t
> master data structures until you are working on a real-world problem and
> discover that a hash is the solution to your performance woes. But even as a
> student you should focus on learning not the minutia details but the
> practicalities: When do you want a hash? When do you want a tree? When is a
> min-heap the right solution?

## Concurrency

Know about concurrency (mutexes, deadlocks, livelocks, threads, semaphores etc.)

- Book: Concurrency programming in Java
