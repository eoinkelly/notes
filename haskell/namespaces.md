# Two namespaces (types, values)

* Haskell code is split up into two namespaces

1. Types
2. Values

The type namespace is

* after :: (the stuff on the left is in the value namespace) in function
  declarations and in record syntax
* after `type`
* between `class` and `where`
* between `instance` and `where`
* between `data` and `=`
