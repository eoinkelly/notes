# Two namespaces (types, values)

- Haskell code is split up into two namespaces

1. Types
2. Values

The type namespace is

- after :: (the stuff on the left is in the value namespace) in function
  declarations and in record syntax
- after `type`
- between `class` and `where`
- between `instance` and `where`
- between `data` and `=`
