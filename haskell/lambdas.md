# Lambdas

```
\x -> (x, 3, 4)
```

- a lambda extends from the `\` to the next newline|;|)|}|]
- you can do pattern matching in lambdas but it is rarely used since you can
  only write one branch and if it fails you will get a runtime exception

Aside: when pattern matching make sure you have covered all the possibilities or
you will end up with a runtime exception!
