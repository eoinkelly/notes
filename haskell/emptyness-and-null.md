# Empty things

- there is no null or void type
- uses `()` as the convertion to denote something empty
- the type of `()` is `()`
    ```
    :t ()
    () :: ()
    ```
- `undefined` is used to represent some sort of error state - it is not
  something to expect as return value etc.
    ```
    :t undefined
    undefined ::
    ```

    - it is a polymorphic constant i.e. a value that can take on any type (no
      restrictions)
