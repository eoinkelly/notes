# Haskell pragmas

```
{-# word ... #-}
{-# word ...
  #-}

```

- the closing `#-}` must start in a column to the right of the opening `{-#` -
  this is called the "layout rule"
- `word` must be recognised by the compiler

## File header pragmas

- must precede the `module` keyword in the file
- valid words are
    - LANGUAGE
        - specify language extensions (ideally all compilers will use this)
    - INCLUDE
        - Include header files for any C files you are building
        - No longer required for GHC but there for compatibility
    - OPTIONS_GHC
        - specify options for GHC compiler

## Other pragmas (that are in Yesod)

- UNPACK
    - unpack the contents of a constructor field into the consturctor itself
    - it removes a level of indirection
    - `data Foo = Foo {-# UNPACK #-} Float` ??? is this correct?
    - it is a compiler optimisation
- IF/ELSE/ENDIF
    - I think these are C compiler macros
