# Radio basics

## Bands

| Band name                  | Frequency range | Wavelength |
| -------------------------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| Very low frequency (VLF)   | 3 - 30 kHz      |            |
| Low frequency (LF)         | 30 - 300 kHz    |            |
| Mid frequency (MF)         | 300 kHz - 3 MHz | ?          |
| High Frequency (HF)        | 3-30 MHz        | 100m - 10m |
| Very high frequency (VHF)  | 30-300 MHz      | 10m - 1m   |
| Ultra high frequency (UHF) | 300-3000 MHz    | 1m - 10cm  |
| Super high frequency (SHF) | 3-30 GHz        | 10cm - 1cm |

- radio spectrum is 1 Hz -> 3 THz (3000 GHz)
    - everything in this range is called a radio wave
- ITU (International telecommunications union) governs allocation of spectrum
- the boundaries are created arbitrarily by humans not physics
- there is no lower limit to the frequency of a radio wave
- the upper end of the radio spectrum is bounded by the infrared band
-   - terahertz band = 300 GHz to 3 THz
        - can be considered either microwaves or infrared

10 kHz = wavelength 30 km you would need an "eleveated wire antenna" kilometers
in diameter for this and lower frequencies

antenna size increases in direct proportion to wavelength (aka inverse direct
proportion to frequency) longer wavelength => you need bigger antenna higher
frequencey => you need a bigger antenna?

Audio modulation is impractical below 30 kHz - only slow baud rate data is used
here

Lowest frequences used for radio comms are ~80 kHz ELF submarine comms system
ground dipole antennas 20-60km long excited my megawatts of transmitter power
transmit data at 1 bit per minute (approx 5 mins per characther)

Highest frequencies useful for radio lmited by the absorption of microwave
energy by the atmosphere Above 30 GHz atmospheric gases absorb increasing amouns
of power so the power required to send increases exponentially with distance At
30 GHz useful comms limited to approx 1km Above 300GHz radio waves are
attenuated to 0 within a few meters by the atmosphere

AM radio

Longwave AM = 148.5 kHz - 283.5 kHz (LF band) Mediumwave AM = 520 kHz - 1700 kHz
(MF band) Shortwave AM = 3 MHz - 30 Mhz (HF band)

Amateur radio bands are usuall in the HF but can be in VHF and UHF

FM band in Japan = 76 - 95 MHz

My radio: AM ~ 500 kHz - 1800 kHz FM ~ 80 MHz to 109 MHz

RF can be generated either intentionally or unintentionally by devices

## Broadcast radio in NZ

- FM in New Zealand
    - is in range 88.4-106.63
- AM stations
    - are in 531 kHz - 1593 kHz (i.e. mediumwave AM stations)
    - The numbers quoted in advertisign are 10's of kHz
- Lower power FM
    - 87.6 - 88.3 MHz (just below the normal licensed FM band)
    - 106.7 - 107.7 MHz (just above the normal licensed FM band)

# HAM radio in NZ

- After you qualify you can operate
    - bands below 5 MHz and above 25 MHz for 3 months
    - after that all amateur radio bands
- Call signs
    ```
    ZL1ABCD
    ZL = New Zealand
    1 = 1-4, indicates ??
    ABCD = unique suffix for your call-sign
    ```

## Morse code

- called CW in Amateur radio circles
- international requirements are 5 words per min or 12 wpm
