Design decision styles

1. Unintended Design something gets made without anyone considering the design
   not always bad - it's a game of chance - even a blind squirrel finds an acorn
   every so often design decisions are informed by "what's easiest to implement"

2. Self Design teams design purely for themselves better odds of success than
   unintended but not by much works best if the team members are the primary
   users of the application design decisions informed by the team's own use of
   the product - the more they use it the better it will be

3. Genius Design as in self-design genius design the team doesn't look beyond
   their own experience to inform their decisions - they look to the vast
   previous experience of the team members works well with experienced teams -
   if you hve designed 5 shopping carts, each complete with thorough research on
   the users and their scenarios and follow-up work to see how well design met
   expectations then designing a 6th shopping cart without any rigorous research
   will probably produce great results. There has to have been solid research in
   the past to base the current decisions on - just having designed the
   functionality before doesn't count unless the research also went with it

4. Activity-Focused Design Teams plan & execute research looking at the users'
   activities. teams need this style when the activities are new or foreign to
   the team members and they can't rely on their own experience - often uses
   activitey based thecniques such as \*workflow diagramming** and **task-based
   usability testing\*\*.

5. User-Focused Design these teams conduct the most user reseawrch - looking
   beyond activities they look in-depth at goals, needs and context of the users
   the team will use user-focused techniques such as field research and robust
   persona creation ensuring the team understands the contextual nature of the
   users' experience

THe most effective teams are skilled in all 5 styles, choosing the style that
fits best depending on the goals of the project. It's important to know which
style to use in which project - be conscious of which one you are using
