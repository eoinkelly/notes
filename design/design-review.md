These are in no particular order, and I don’t ask all of them every time.

What does it say? What does it mean? Is what it says and what it means the same
thing? Do we want that? Why do we need to say that here? If you stopped reading
here, what’s the message? What’s the take away after 8 seconds? How does this
make you feel? What’s down below? How else can we say this? What’s memorable
about this? What’s that for? Who needs to know that? Who needs to see that? How
does that change behavior? What’s the payoff? What does someone know now that
they didn’t know before? How does that work? Why is that worth a click? Is that
worth scrolling? What’s the simpler version of this? Are we assuming too much?
Why that order? Why would this make them choose that? What does a more polished
version of this look like? Why would someone leave at this point? What’s
missing? Why are we saying this twice? Is it worth pulling attention away from
that? Does that make it clearer? What’s the obvious next step? How would someone
know that? Would it matter if someone missed that? Does that make it easier or
harder? Would this be better as a sentence or a picture? Where’s the verb? Why
is that there? What matters here? What would happen if we got rid of that? Why
isn’t that clear? Why is this better? How can we make this more obvious? What
happens when this expands? If we got rid of this, does that still work? Is it
obvious what happens next? What just happened? Where’s the idea? What problem is
that solving? How does this change someone’s mind? What makes this a must have?
