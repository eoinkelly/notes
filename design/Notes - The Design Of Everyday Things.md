# The Design of Everyday Things

mental models
The designer has a mental model of how the system works. The user will also create their own mental model when they use it. The only communication between designer and user is the "system image" - all the responsibility for communicating rests on that

WHen the no. of functions > no. of controls you have a design challenge

additive dimensions:
	length
	loudness
	weight
	brightness
substituve dimensions
	pitch
	taste (to an extent)
	color
	location

product complexity often follows a u curve over it's lifetime; complex at the start but decreasing and then increasing complexity at the end through adding extra features etc.

Declaratie knowledge = easy to write down and teach
Procedural knowledge = best learned by doing or demo, largely subconscious

Knowledge is in your head and in the world
we only store partial descriptions in memory - just enough to allow us to funciton ususally

constraints help memory e.g. rhyming
when disassmebling a device, bolt & nut sizes are a constraint
constraints are good because they reduce the amount that must be learned
short term memory = 5-7 item limit



Decision Trees 
If the structure is narrow, width is not important.     
If the structure is shallow, depth is not important.

Design for error - errors are normal behaviour

Designers should:
1. Understand the causes of error and design to
minimize the causes2. Make it possible tor reverse actions, make it
harder to do what cannot be reversed.3. Make it easier to discover the
errors taht do occur and make them easier to correct.4. Change the
attitude towards errors. Think of the users as **attempting** to do a
task. They are getting there by imperfect approximations of waht is
desired.
Don't punish the user for making errors - don't take offense and don't
ignore them
Forcing functions - a form of physical constraint - failure at one
stage prevents the next stage from happening.
Design evolves through iterations until time, energy & resources run
out. We have to be willing to embrace the thigns that are wrong with
our designs
The curse of designer individuality
If everyday design were ruled by aesthetics, life might be more
pleaseing to the eye but less comfortable; if it was ruled by
usability , it might be more comfortable but uglier.
The reward structure of the design community tends to put aesthetics
firstDesigners are not typical usersDesigners must please clients who
also may not be users.
Designers are often expert at the device they are designing. Users are
expert at the task they are using that device for.
When you are proficient with a product you can operate from the
knowledge in your head. A new user has to operate from the knowledge
in the world.
### 7 Princeiples of transforming difficult tasks into simple ones
1. Use both knowledge in the world and knowledge int he head.
2. Simplify the structure of tasks
3. Make things visible: bridge the gulf between execution and evaluation
4. Get the mappings right.
5. Exploit the power of constraints, both natural and artificial.
6. Design for error.
7. When all else fails, standardize.
