- he uses haskell type signatures as a thinking tool for designing
- it provides a "data first" way of thinking which is quite different to OO
  which tends to be "naming first"
    - => it would be good to have both of these approaches mentally available to
      me when designing a solution
        - changing lens from "data transformations first" to "naming first" may
          help provide better solutions

^^^^^^ USEFUL CONCLUSION
