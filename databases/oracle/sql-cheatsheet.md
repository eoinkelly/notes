- `v$version` is a special table name

- a schema is created in Oracle when a user is created.
    - there is a `CREATE SCHEMA` statement but it just creates multiple objects
      at once

Multi-tenant

- CBD = the "multitenant container DB"
    - multitenant container database (CDB) that includes one or many
      customer-created pluggable databases (PDBs).
- PDB = pluggable DB = the customer's DB
    - you can set it up so when the customer connects they only see their PDB
    - A PDB is a portable collection of schemas, schema objects, and nonschema
      objects that appears to an Oracle Net client as a non-CDB.
- All Oracle databases before Oracle Database 12c were non-CDBs.
- You can unplug a PDB from a CDB and plug it into a different CDB
