# Database branching in Postgres

Database branching is coming (using your database like git). Might not be ready in 2023 but next few years.

The phrase can mean:

* Just schema branching
* Schema + data branching
  * https://planetscale.com/ (MySQL only) talks about "database branching" == "schema only branching" and now have "data branching" which is full database branching

Projects/companies working on branching postgres:

1. Neon has it already (but I think it's only schema branching so far)
1. OrioleDB has it on the roadmap
1. Supabase have it in their roadmap
1. Crunchy bridge (which is a bunch of ex Heroku Postgres people)
