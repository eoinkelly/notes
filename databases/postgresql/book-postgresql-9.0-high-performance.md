# Postgres Contrib

The contrib tools are porting tools, analysis utilities, and plug-in features
that are not part of the core PostgreSQL system.

* brew installs the postgres-contrib tools by default
* `apt-get install postgres-contrib` to get them on Ubuntu

Interesting tools

* Skytools
    * tools from Skype for replication and failover
    * https://wiki.postgresql.org/images/2/28/Moskva_DB_Tools.v3.pdf
* pgpool
    * connection pool manager
* PgBouncer
    * connection pool manager
* pb_buffercache
    * represents the shared buffers as a relation so you can query them
    * can see how much of a relation has been cached
    * this seems like a key tool when performance profiling a DB
    * http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/pgbuffercache.html
* pbtune
    * python script to tweak your postgresql.conf based on detected system params
    * original script untouched since 2013
    * online version has seen more recent work https://github.com/le0pard/pgtune
* pgFouine
    * postgres log analyzer in PHP
    * untouched since 2010

Profiling a database usually starts with OS tools like:

* vmstat
* iostat

TODO: dig into those os level tools sometime (but not urgent) (Sun 29 Mar 00:28:54 2015)

General tips for performance tuning

* find the "current bottleneck" and fix that - the results of other fixes will not be visible
* Approach it at a system level not an individual app level
