#OIDs

- The intention of an OID is to be a unique identifier for rows in tables that
  might not have a primary key. If a table doesn't have a primary key and has
  OIDs then you can still unambigiously refer to any single row for updating or
  deleting.
- An OID is a Postgres datatype - see
  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-oid.html
    - it is an unsigned 4 byte integer (NB: that is not big enough to provide
      uniqueness on large tables)
- In Postgres 8.0 and earlier, user created tables were created with OIDs
  enabled. This behaviour is now deprecated and discouraged.
- Object identifiers (OIDs) are used internally by PostgreSQL as primary keys
  for various system tables

> There are also several alias types for oid: regproc, regprocedure, regoper,
> regoperator, regclass, regtype, regrole, regnamespace, regconfig, and
> regdictionary.

> An additional property of most of the OID alias types is the creation of
> dependencies. If a constant of one of these types appears in a stored
> expression (such as a column default expression or view), it creates a
> dependency on the referenced object. For example, if a column has a default
> expression nextval('my_seq'::regclass), PostgreSQL understands that the
> default expression depends on the sequence my_seq; the system will not let the
> sequence be dropped without first removing the default expression
