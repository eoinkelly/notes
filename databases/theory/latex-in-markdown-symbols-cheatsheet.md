### In my vim setup:

In our markdown rendering, there are multiple levels of quoting happening so we
have to escape \ to make it be passed as a literal \ to mathjax

- Delimit latex blocks with `$$`
- Delimit latex inline with `\\( ... \\)`

### For VS Code

- Delimit latex blocks with `$$`
- Delimit latex inline with `$`

VS Code Examples

$$E \in S$$ $$E \notin S$$

$$S1 \subset S2$$ $$S1 \subseteq S2$$

$$S1 \supset S2$$ $$S1 \supseteq S2$$

$$S_{empty} = \{1, 3\}$$
