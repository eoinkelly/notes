# Graph databases

## Basics

* Relationships are first-class citizens in graph DBs
* Terminology
    * nodes (or vertices)
        * store data entities
    * edges
        * store relationships
        * an edge is (conceptually at least) a tuple of `(start-node, end-node, type, direction)` - note the **type** and **direction**
* Advantages
    * Queries are apparently faster for highly interconnected datasets
    * Modelling highly interconnected datasets is much more intuitive (allegedly, I have not verified this)

Graph DBs are "schema on read" i.e. your code needs to know the schema to read data

## heuristics to know when to reach for a graphDB instead of a relational DB

It seems like you should start by modelling relationally and then move to graphs if:

1. You have frequent many-many relationships which make querying the data difficult in a relational model
1. Your relational queries are slow and there aren't other things you can do to speed them up

## Popular graph databases

* Neo4j https://neo4j.com/
    * Supports Cypher and Gremlin query languages
    * Apparently this is the most popular GraphDB according to Neo4j
* Datomic https://www.datomic.com/
    * Uses _Datalog_ as a query language
    * Is an immutable append-only data storage
* Oracle supports graph data
* MS SQL Server supports graph data
* AWS Neptune
    * ACID compliant
    * Uses either _Property Graph_ or _RDF_ data models
    * Allows import of CSV data from S3
    * Allows querying in either _Gremlin_ or _SPARQL_ query languages
    * Can import from CSV, RDF, GraphML files or from a DynamoDB stream
* Azure Cosmos DB supports graph data
* Apache Tinkerpop
    * http://tinkerpop.apache.org/

### Graph models

1. Property Graph
    * Uses _Apache tinkerpop gremlin_ as query language
1. RDF
    * Uses _SPARQL_ as query language

### Query languages

1. Graph DB query languages are not standardised like SQL is but there are some "multi-vendor" query languages:
    * SPARQL
        * works with RDF databases
    * Cypher
        * Created for Neo4j, used by Neo4j
    * Gremlin
        * Works with many backends
        * Part of the _Apache Tinkerpop_ project
1. GraphQL
    * A query language for any backend service
1. Datalog
    * Used by datomic

Graph DBs may also be accessed directly via APIs (i.e. not using a query language)

### Underlying storage options

* Table (relational model) storage
* Key value (or document) storage
