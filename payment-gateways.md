# Payment gateways

Important features of a payment gateway

1. Authorize
    - validate the credit card and reserve the money for later collection
1. Capture
    - references a previous Authorize step and requests that the money be drawn
      down
    - some areas require that you not capture until the goods have been shipped
1. Purchase
    - Authorize + Capture in a single transaction
1. Void
    - Entirely void a transaction
1. Credit
    - Refund money to a card
    - Not all gateways support this
    - Those that do may have to explicitly eanble it for your account
    - typically hard to get permission to do this (void is more usual)
1. Recurring
1. Card Store

- tokenizes a payment method in a gateway's vault
- often has 3 endpoints
    1. store
    1. unstore
    1. update

AM makes distinction between a "Gateway" and an "Integration"

- gateway
    - ecomm app uses payment provider to process the payment but they hold all
      the details
    - ecomm app holds CC details so needs PCI compliance
- integration e.g. paypal
    1. ecomm app redirects user to the provider with details of payment
    1. user authenticates with provider and makes the payment
    1. provider will often hit a known callback URL on the ecomm app to verify
       that the payment details are correct
    1. provider sends user back to ecomm iste
- hybrid
    - tries to avoid having the ecomm app knowing payment details but retain the
      flexibility of a gateway

Ideally gateways have a "verify" endpoint that allows us to verify the card with
a 0 dollar transaciton. If the gateway doesn't support it it is supported via an
authorize and immediate void

Braintree provides only "integrations" because it does not expose an API

## Luhn mod 10 algorithm

- a checksum algorithm
- not cryptographically secure
- can find _accidental_ errors in credit card numbers
- can find
    - any single digit errors
    - transposition of adjacent digits It is 16 numeric characters and conforms
      to a Luhn "mod 10" algorithm
