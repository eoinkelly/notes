https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors

save your overrides in the app/overrides, normally one override per file using
the same file name as specified in the :name argument.

the required args have three sections

- target
    - `:virtual_path`
        - the template that the override should take effect
        - is the segement of the view path: `app/views/{virtual path}.html.erb`
- action
    - the action to take on the targetted node
    - `replace: "selector"
        - selector can match multiple times in the targetted template
- source
    - where to find the new nodes
    - can be inline string, another template or a partial
    - can be a cut/copy/paste from some other targetting!

optional args

- name
    - tag the override with a name so it can be referred to later
    - needs to be unique within the same virtual path
- attributes
    - XML attributes to be set on the replacement node

In the DSL the filename provides the `virtual_path` and `name` attribute

```
app/overrides/{virtual path}/{name}.deface
```

```ruby
Deface::Override.new(:virtual_path => "posts/_form",
                     :name => "example-1",
                     :replace => "h1",
                     :text => "<h1>New Post</h1>")
```
