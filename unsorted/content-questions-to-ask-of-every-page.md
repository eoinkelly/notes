Make the right thing the easy thing on the page

Ginny Reddish
==============
	"When you're writing for the Web, keep your paragraphs short.
	"Three sentences is good.
	"Two sentences is even better.
	"One sentence is best.
	"Unless a fragment will do the job."

    when you write, you should write to achieve some tangible change in the world
        change what the reader knows
        change how they feel
            help them do/achieve something

Kim’s thinking is there are only five questions that are essential to creating great designs:

What is the user trying to accomplish?
What does the user need to know to accomplish their goal?
How should the user feel as they accomplish it?
How does the current design (or alternative) currently make them feel?
What did they do to accomplish it?
She boils it down to three essential components: Accomplish, Know, and Feel. If you understand what your user wants to accomplish, what they need to know, and how they want to feel, you’re well on your way discovering what’s necessary for your design to be great.


# General Ideas
We have to do the hard work of sorting through the company info and presenting it in a way that makes most sense to the customer - if we just dump it on the page they we are expecting them to do the sorting - that makes us look lazy and a bit dumb.

# Questions

* Why did they click on the link that brought them to this page?
* What are they trying to do on this page? (what info do they want? what task are they performing?)
	* Given only 5 secs to look at the page, would they think that this page is relevant to that task?
* What information are we giving on the page?
	* What are we trying to persuade them of on this page?
	* (see content sanity checks)
* What do we want them to **do** on this page?
* What do we want them to do after this page?
* Imagine this page is a new employee you are hiring. Would they be in sales, customer support, marketing? What would their job description be?
* Have we clearly asked the customer to perform the most important actions? Or have we left it up to them to figure out what to do.
* Have we made the right thing the easy thing on the page?

## The Bigger picture

1. What tasks is the customer trying to accomplish that led them to click on a link to this page?
	these tasks are usually larger than one page - the customer will not think in terms of pages!

To evaluate the task as a whole, see how it "flows" - how much does the user have to remember to complete the task - do they have to jump around the site a lot or is there a flow with only the possible next tasks visible (or at least most prominent) (design of everyday things ideas mesh here)

## Customer shoes exercise

* What audience groups will view this page (list in order of their importance to the organisation)
* For each audience group, imagine you are that customer:
* what questions do you hav ein your head when you clicked on the link to this page?
* Consider the question: "Is this info relevant to what I am trying to do?" Will that be yes/no for this page? Why?
* why did you click on the link to this page?
	* what did that link say?
	* what questions/tasks are you hoping to answer by clicking on that link?
* what are you hoping to find here?
	* ask why you were looking for this repeatedly until you get down to the basic human needs
* what are you worried about?
* Considering the title of the page (the label of the link you clicked):
	* What would you expect to find on that page?
	* What would consitute a successful version of that page
	* Give examples of how that page could fail
* Looking at the page
	* What is your gut first impressions - just free style it.
	* Which content on the page is relevant to you. WHich is not?
* Did this page ahve what you expected? If not, how was it different?


## Authors Content Sanity Checks

1. Have I clearly defined the nature of the product (as opposed to the commodity)?
1. I am trying to "inform" and "persuade" – is there a good balance between these?
1. Have I talked about the benefits that this particular product/service can offer to the customer? (features of interest)
1. Have I explained how this product/service is different and superior to a competitors?
1. Have I clearly explained *why* the customer needs this product/service? Have I addressed their pain points.
1. Have I written this with the target audience in mind?
1. Is what I have written easy to understand.
1. Are there too many sentences talking about the companies status and brand rather than the benefits that this product/service can offer the customer? Customers do not want to read about our brand – they just want to know how it helps them.
1. How would the time-pressed, slightly stressed, critical customer read this copy?
1. Would I be happy to take this copy and use it as part of a sales call? Imagine I am standing in front of a room of customer – how would refering to this make me feel?
1. Can I reduce or remove any of this content and still make my message clear?
1. Looking at the page from the POV of a customer, do we look like we are trying to make things easy for them or trying to flog our product/give em the hard sell?
