# Gerry McGovern webinar

1. Develop the task list
	Sources of tasks
		corporate philosophy
		stakeholder interviews
		customer feedback and surveys
		help desk
		existing website
		competitor websites
		in-site search
		boilerplate list from previous projects

2. Give it to customers and find top tasks

3 See how well you are doing on the top tasks - measure: 
	task performance
	success rate
	failure rate
	disaster rate
	median time on task
	target time on task

	and use the TPI formula from the book to generate a measure you can show management

	This step has a lot of crossover with usability research but the difference is that we are doing this for **management** outcomes, not design outcomes.

GM reckons the top 3 tasks become stable after 100 voters and the top 10 stable after 400
	information is a means to an end
	websites are "doing places" and or "reading places"
