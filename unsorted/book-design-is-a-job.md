based on the fact that for a project to be successful, there are things that must happen, should happen.

make a table with column headings:
	Thing that needs to be done
	Who the client would like to be responsible for it
		us/them/3rd party. some of these things will be stuff that only we can do, some things that only the client can do, and the others we negotiate/avise w. the client on

optionally add
	Time allocated for the thing



would be nice to be to be able to give client a ball-park figure quickly
make it clear that this project proposal is being created in iterations - maybe move away from the “quote’ language - ella has always used ‘proposal’ - i think this is smart, make it clear that it’s an iterative proposal - a launch point for discussion and negotiation.
