Marketing consists of advertising and promoting your service in order to sell it. it lets potential customers know what you have available for sale. marketing is a broad term that covers advertising, public relations and sales

The American Marketing Association's definition of marketing is:
"The process of planning and executing the conception, pricing, promotion and distribution of ideas, goods, and services to create exchanges that satisfy individual and organizational objectives."

 These are often called the four "P's" of marketing:

Product
Price
Promotion
Place (how you distribute it)
If you cover the four P's well, you should have no trouble achieving a fifth P: profits.

They think marketing also covers product design???

It is important to note that the field of marketing includes sales, but it also includes many functions besides sales.

Marketing is the process of teaching consumers why they should choose your product or service over your competitors; if you are not doing that you are not marketing. Itâ€™s really that simple! The key is finding the right method and defining the right message to use to educate and influence your consumers.

What is the difference between marketing and sales?
Let's think about this question for a moment. Without marketing you would not have prospects or leads to follow up with, but yet without a good sales technique and strategy your closing rate may depress you.

The best way to distinguish between advertising and marketing is to think of marketing as a pie, inside that pie you have slices of advertising, market research, media planning, public relations, product pricing, distribution, customer support, sales strategy, and community involvement. Advertising only equals one piece of the pie in the strategy.
