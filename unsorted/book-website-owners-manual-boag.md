"Context is king"

The online reading context:

* Reading from a screen
	causes eye strain
Hyperlinks
	content must be written to be modular
Easy for users to leave
	if they get frustrated they will leave

Copy needs to be
	clear
	concise
	engaging
	modular (users might not have read all)
	well organised (because of the hyperlinks)
	help the user to avoid thinking!

Can i reduce or remove this to make my message clearer?
"Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences"
Krug recommends getting rid of half the words and then half of them again

Advantages of less content
	reduces chance of user becoming lost
	makes useful content more prominient
	prevents users from being overwhelmed
	helps users find content more quickly

1. Does this content help meet business objectives
	Will the 'history' page help me sell more widgets? If it doesn't then it shouldn't appear.
Does it contribute to success criteria
What would the user personas think of the content?
	Will they read it?
	Will it help them complete their goals?
	If not, remove it

Types of content to remove
	marketing blurb
		full of self importance
		devoid of real information
		shouts about how good a product/service is without any tangible evidence to back it up
		marketing blurb = "happy talk" - it doesn't answer user's questions or direct them towards their goal. it's the written equivalent of small-talk
		good promotional copy informs as well as sells (persuades)
	instructional text
		users rarely read it - they prefer to muddle through rather than read the instructions

Card sorting
	good way of creating a basic IA with site owner
	can also do with end user but might be better to give them a structure to comment on rather than a blank canvas - the idea is to reveal their mental model

Create scenarios/use cases to document a user in a particular task-flow. also inlcud what happens when it goes wrong. without those we might not grasp the extent of the work or the additional copy required.

Is this copy scannable (how do i test that)
Is it clear? Are there long sentences, complex punctuation and uncommon words?
Is the content front-loaded? Is the page as a whole front loaded? Is the section front loaded

break content down into headings, subheadings, bullet lists, pull quotes to make it easier to scan
