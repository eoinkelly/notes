QUesitons

What order do we do things to sort out content

	do IA:
		define site structure and what pages there will be
	then create page table for each page
	do qualitive content audit of existing site
	do language mood boards
	do a style-guide if appropriate

How do I get good microcopy on to the site?
	decide whoe the writers on the project are
		me (as developer) doing microcopy
		people from the client

How do i tell the client what microcopy they need to come up with?		
	how do i get it out of the client?
	how do I give them (or whoever is doing the writing) a *spec* for microcopy?

skills to learn: page tables, qualititive content audit

Video Notes
================

* You don't usually have to ask about changing microcopy
* To become a good writer you have to do a lot of shitty writing first. Then recognise you can improve on it and revise it rather than publishing anyway or hiding it away.
* People don't skim read stuff they are insterested in? RB thinks this is true if the content is good enough to warrant reading in the first place.

Ideally designers an devs need to have access to the writing so they can design stuff appropriate for it

I should be asking for budget for a writer or training budget for the people who do end up doing it. Even if I know I won't get it.


* Always stop when it's going well so you have something to lead you back into your train of thought
	* can i give myself/clients some constraints for writing 
		word count?
		scope ???
		page table?

* The most important content should be ready during the planning stage. If we have a few examples of each thing with proper photos and a proper price (if appropriate). It is better to know if the content they generate is bad early on you can get them to fix it. I *need* this for the designers and devs to do their job.

If the project manager is the client side:
If you ask for content ahead of time you are making the project managers' job more difficult. You need to deal with that in the initial meeting
* Ask the project manager nicely about getting the content earlier than they expect to give it (they prob expect to do it at the end) - it's very motivating for people to see *any* real stuff up there and might help them give you better stuff later on.

Quantitive Content Audit
===================

IAs do a quantitive audit that includes:
	Where does each piece of content link to
	who owns it
	volume of content
	where it links to


Qualititive Content Audit
===============
We need to do a *qualitive* audit:
	Is this good quality content?
	Assess this content against the other content on the site
	Would I want to read it?
	Can I merge this content into other stuff?
	What tone of voice does the contnet use?
	Can I re-use it?

	It gives you ideas about what content *could* be there - it lets you see the gaps.

example qualititive line:
	<choice-id> <page-name-or-title-or-desciptive-id> <url> <notes>

choice-id example: 
	3.5.6 => third choice on the homepage, then 5th choice from menu on next page, then 6th choice on next page

* the tone of voice should match the design
* to an extent, how it looks **is** part of the content!

Language Mood Boards Exercise
===============

* helps set tone of voice for the site
* "Does this word fit with the feeling I am establishing for my site"
* takes words from newspapers and puts them together - a bit like a ransom note
* http://www.visualthesaurus.com/ - pretty cool way of finding related words

Guide for writing content
==========================

A guide for writing content (M.M.CTA.):
	Message(s)
		what is your primary, secondary, tertirary messages?
		how does each message tie into business objectives
	Method(s)
		how are you getting the mssage across e.g. video, text, pics, full musical number etc.
	Call To Action(s)
		what do we want them to do once they have absorbed our message?
		invite somebody to take a **directed** step

Page Table
===============

* Example: http://24ways.org/2011/extracting-the-content
* there is a form version of this page available from the video page (i think)
* defining this stuff allows them to bring in a professional writer and have them know what to do
* can tell the clients that all this stuff has to be filled in before we go live or we can get a writer in.
* page tables let clients get their heads around "content" wihtout having to come up with all of it
* page tables are kind of a "commissioning sheet" for the content.
* it's similar to what editors give writers in newspaper world
* this stuff gets the "content spec" out of the client
* Page tables are crucial to the continual growth and maintenance of a truly *content-led* site. Whatif site is not content-led?
A page table contains:

	* Page objective
	* Source Content
	* Scope ???
	* Title
	* Messages (what things (probably plural) is this page trying to get across, what user objectives are we trying to satisfy, what business objectives are we trying to satisfy)
		* Priority Content
		* Secondary Content
		* Tertiary Content
	* Methods (what methods are we boing to use to get the message across). e.g. written covering X, Y, Z.
	* Calls to action (what actons do we ant them to take)
	* Who is responisble for creation
	* Who is responsible for maintenance, how often reviewed
	* Technology/publishing/policy implications
		* e.g. do they want a complex google maps implementation & is that ready?
	* Reliance on third parties
	* Outstanding questions

The page table allows the client to hire a writer when/if it is required.

can also give the writer a style guide e.g. http://www.leeds.ac.uk/comms/styleguide/guide.pdf

Very few writers enjoy writing ...

Big Content Vs Little Contents
====================

* Big Content:
	* The stuff that only clients can come up with 

* Little content (microcopy): 
	* We all have to improve our wirting
		* http://copyblogger.com has copywriting 101 which is good
		* Book recommendation by RB: Writing to sell by Andy Maslin
		* Relly presentation: http://www.webdirections.org/resources/relly-annett-baker-all-the-small-things-2/
		* look at offline media like advertising e.g. agency "gray" sp?

Dealing with Old/outdated content that client might not want to remove: Orphaning pages
=============================================
Give them the link and they can promote it as they want but unless it gets a certain minimum number of hits it's not included in the main navigation - headscape use this

The case for good copy
======================
RB thinks 
	consistent copy provides security against phising attacks
	better microcopy means less support issues, more trust from clients

	Tom Mollerus
		"Design for a user's goals"
		"Use text... that describes the user's goal"
		"If you ask too much, people will tell you to jog on."
		"For every form field you ask people to fill in, you are chipping away at their desire to use your product"
		"Save a user time by pre-filling fields"
	3 Steps for Error copy
		1. State the error
		2. Explain the error
		3. Create a path to a solution
	Book: Content Strategy for the web by Kristina Halvorson


http://24ways.org/2011/extracting-the-content
Don't refer to "THE CONTENT" - we are actually talking about lots of little contents
Don't plan content top-down - go bottom up, start with the small bits - get clients started on doing little bits
maybe one blog post, one product, one page


Microcopy
==============

* http://24ways.org/2009/the-construction-of-instruction

1. Plan what you want to say as early as possible
2. Value clarity over brevity - when it doubt, spell it out
3. Be prepared to help - try to help your users
4. Be direct and informative. Squash jargon
