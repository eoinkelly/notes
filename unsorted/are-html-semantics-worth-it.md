Should I bother with HTML semantics

For:
* Non-visual UAs will catch up and start using the extra semantics to make pages better for their users. Does that mean that non-visual UAs are the big use-case?
* The html5 spec is still in flux, it will settle down
* Once I understand the new elements, there is no reason not to use them (once all browsers support them). (this isn't the same as a reason to use them)
* It will affect the outline algorithm for sure. What are the good reasons for caring about that. JK: "he new outline algorithm in HTML5 will make life a lot easier for future assistive technology and searchbots"
* 

Against:
* No machines can counsume the extra semtantics.
* People keep talking about "future machines" that will consume this extra information but in the history of the web we haven't built them? why do we think we will?
* Most(?) web constent is stored in DB now which gives it an existing structure - HTML is not the storage method, it's just an artifact generated for browsers


Markup structures content. True
How much structure is required. As much as the consumers of the content can use.
Who are the consumers? User agents.
Do they use the extra structure? Not really (slight changes at moment)
Have they asked for the structure? Not to my knowledge.

"It's just the right thing to do"
This has an opportunity cost associated with it in terms of my time. also it's faith based.

The original intention of the web was web pages as repositories of content (mini databases of a sort)

What are the specific reasons in favour of using semantics that are not
* No reason NOT to use them
* Some {imaginary future machine} will consume them.


OK so it does affect the outline and browsers do style differently based on that.
