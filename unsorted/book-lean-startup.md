# lean startup
build -> measure -> analyise

An infinte number of things could go wrong. We want to find out what *will* go wrong as early as possible.

lean startup is an adpation of the lean manufactureing idea


good metrics are
actionable
	you can understand what caused it
auditable 
	you want to use them to learn 
	"metrics are people too"
	we ust be able to check that the numbers are accurate
accessible
	you shouldn't need a data analyst to interpret the data
	everyone in the company should be able to access it ideally

what are the business reasons for knowing this?
what level do i need to know this stuff to *advance* my business - not for "ideal world where I'm good at everything"

just in time not just in case

who are the people who could really benefit from this product and how do I start communicating with them as quickly as possible?


what is this scrum story thing

cohort analysis

am I doing stuff for my business that I don't have to?
