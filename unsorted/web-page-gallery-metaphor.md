decide how I want them to understand galleries
    options
        gallery as a custom post type
            + separate in admin
            + same gallery can be added to multiple pages
            + can have multiple galleries on the same page

        gallery on every page
            + no need to create a gallery to put pics on the page
            - can't separate images on the same page into multiple galleries - required?
            - not possible to show the same gallery on multiple pages - e.g. all pages in student council
            ? there is no notion of a gallery page - does this make it difficult for them to talk about e.g. 'the TY gallery'

        how do the gallery plugins do it?
        which of the approaches is easier to understand for users?
        which is more "wordpressy"?

        how to have multiple gallerys on the same page?
