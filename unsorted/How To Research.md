research is:
	source material
		downloaded files
		paper books
		pdfs
		kindle ebooks
		links to online content/instapaper
		amazon wishlist
		links to books i haven't bought
		podcasts
		safari books


	my research notes
		text files
		google doc

		notes are the artefact of my research - they are not the main result - my new understanding of the topic is
		notes are just to help the topic to go into my brain and refresh it if i need to pick it up again
		the purpose of my notes is to help me pick up where I left off quickly


maybe work out reading time for each

how do i decide what to learn? what is worth reading?
i find myself "organising" my research notes a lot - is that a pointless activity?
