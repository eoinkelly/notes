# Notes from book
emotional design makes the user feel as if there is a real person at the end of the connection

I am aiming for long term remarkablility.

We are aiming to create a positive **emotional** response in our users

don't use the royal "we" to make our organisation seem bigger than it is

use honesty as a brand personality value

people tend to see human characteristics in everything e.g. smiley face. we should encourage this behaviour.

heirarchy of user needs
	functional -> reliable -> usable -> pleasurable

Hicks law: the time taken to make a decision increases w. the no. of choices

Every time we add content to an interface it makes it harder for humans to identify patterns and contrasting elements - this results in unpredictable user behaviour and lower info retention

branding = creating cognitive contrast

## aesthetic-usability principle
reply to the "how it looks doesn't matter" argument: job interview in pjyamas

let users "get a sense of the creator" from a site

emotional experiences make a more profound impact on memory than non-emotional ones.
the emotional conneciotn is not really logical. it builds up "love capital" you might need if you screw up e.g. site down.

to engage emotionally (as with personal interactions) you ahve to let your personality show

human emotional firmware
	we are ahrdwired to love babies
	we percieve humanity (ourselves) in interfaces
	our brains search for patterns and breaks in thsoe patterns (contrast)
		our brains use that contrast to decide "Is it good or bad for me"
		visual contrast: diff color, shape, form
		cognitive contrast: diff in experiences or memories
	page simplicity helps us do cost/benefit analytis (our brains do this immediately after content scanning) - this mostly happens at the automatic, fast, subconscious level.o

our emotions play a big part in decision making - people with damaged emotion centers find it very hard to make decisions - an awful lot of decisions come down to gut instinct
