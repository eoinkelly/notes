# Rick hickey hammock driven development talk

* Avoiding problems != answering them
* No garantee that the sum of features is going to solve anyone's problem (is this the defn. of UX???)

* Solving problems requires
  1. understand it
  2. recognize it
  3. state it

Problem solving is a skill separate to other skills

* State the problem (out loud, on paper) - need to be able to express it in words
* Understand the problem.
    * Identify what do you know?
        * facts?
        * context?
        * constraints?
    * Identify waht you don't know?
    * Are there related problems?
        * Looking at solutions to similar problems is a great way to get a head start
    * Write it all down somehow

    * Find the problems in your own solution
        * errors of logic
        * errors of taste/judgement
        * errors of implementation
        * try to solve these too!
    * The chances of there being no trade-offs is almost zero - identify them!

Training yourself for problem solving
* You can't connect things you don't know about
* Read in and around your space
* Look critically at other solutions

What is a trade-off?
* It is not the parts of your software that suck!
* You need to look at at least two possible solutions _and_ figure out what is good and bad about those - *then and only then can you say you "made a trade-off"*

Focus is really important to do design
* You need to get away from the computer to do this - they are too distracting!!!
* You can't do everything - you will drop balls
* Let loved ones know that you'll be "gone" - explain that this is the nature of this kind of work
