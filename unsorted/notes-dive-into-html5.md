HTML 5 Elemnents
http://www.diveinto.org/html5/semantics.html
div, id
	have no semantics (user agent is not allowed to infer any meaning from the value of this tag  or attribute)

hgroup
	for when a <hX> element does not represent a new section e.g. a tagline

the document outline can get messed up if you use h1-h6 outside of and inside of <article> etc. so it's best not to mix them.
