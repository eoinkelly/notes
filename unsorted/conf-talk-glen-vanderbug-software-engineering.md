# engineering models for software engineering

defined process
    * every piece understnood
    * process can be started and allwod to run to completion with the *same* results every time

VS

emperical process
    * provides and exercises control through frequent inspection and adaptation
    * fro processes that are imperfectly defined and generate unpredictable and unrepeatable results
    * common in chemical engineering

* What is expensive in other engineering disiplines is cheap in ours e.g. creating prototypes
