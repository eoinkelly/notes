# engineering models for software engineering

defined process _ every piece understnood _ process can be started and allwod to
run to completion with the _same_ results every time

VS

emperical process _ provides and exercises control through frequent inspection
and adaptation _ fro processes that are imperfectly defined and generate
unpredictable and unrepeatable results \* common in chemical engineering

- What is expensive in other engineering disiplines is cheap in ours e.g.
  creating prototypes
