Great Quotes from the Clean Coder
--------------------------------


* Professionalism is a loaded term. Certainly it is a badge of honor and pride, but it is also a marker of responsibility and accountability. The two go hand in hand, of course. You can’t take pride and honor in something that you can’t be held accountable for

* Doing your daily job is performance, not practice.

* Slaves are not allowed to say no. Laborers may be hesitant to say no. But professionals are expected to say no. Indeed, good managers crave someone who has the guts to say no. It’s the only way you can really get anything done. This should be self-evident. When the cost of failure is so high that the survival of your company depends upon it, you must be absolutely determined to give your managers the best information you can. And that often means saying no.

Software development is a marathon, not a sprint. You can’t win the race by trying to run as fast as you can from the outset. You win by conserving your resources and pacing yourself.

* Kent Beck once told me something profound: “Any argument that can’t be settled in five minutes can’t be settled by arguing.” The reason it goes on so long is that there is no clear evidence supporting either side. The argument is probably religious, as opposed to factual.

* Instead of looking around in a panic for something, anything, that will help you get done faster, become more deliberate and dedicated to following your chosen disciplines. If you follow TDD, then write even more tests than usual. If you are a merciless refactorer, then refactor even more. If you keep your functions small, then keep them even smaller. The only way through the pressure cooker is to rely on what you already know works—your disciplines.

* Craftsmanship is the mindset held by craftsmen. Craftsmanship is a meme that contains values, disciplines, techniques, attitudes, and answers

Professionals do not succumb to the temptation to create a mess in
order to move quickly. Professionals realize that “quick and dirty” is
an oxymoron. Dirty always means slow!

If you follow the discipline of Test Driven Development in noncrisis
times but abandon it during a crisis, then you don’t really trust that
TDD is helpful. If you keep your code clean during normal times but
make messes in a crisis, then you don’t really believe that messes
slow you down. If you pair in a crisis but don’t normally pair, then
you believe pairing is more efficient than non-pairing.

Choose disciplines that you feel comfortable following in a crisis.
Then follow them all the time. Following these disciplines is the best
way to avoid getting into a crisis.

Don’t change your behavior when the crunch comes. If your disciplines
are the best way to work, then they should be followed even in the
depths of a crisis.
