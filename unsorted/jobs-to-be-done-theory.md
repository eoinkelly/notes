Jobs to be done theory
=======================

research into what people actually buy

what are the jobs (plural) that a web project is hired for?
the factors that affect hiring might be different from those that affect satisfaction

the job is technology and product independant

facebook replaced the sunday night phonecall for people away from family

sit down iwth the customer and map out the *story* of how they purchased the thing

Six scenes in the comic strip of buying:

	1. first thought

	<he doesnt mention the other steps in the podcast>
	
	6. judging satisfaction

simplicity is often more important than option value as the many options places a burden on the consumer - too much choice is paralyzing

observation of actual behaviour is more important than asking people what they want

you need to get people to "re-live" and replay the story - if you ask them what their "looking back" view is is - people always post rationalize when looking back

design is evloving so that desingers start by doing a sort of "jobs to be done" research

association vs causality
i want product to be fun
bright colors are fun
=> make the product bright colors

but bright colors do not cause fun.

is sales the happy home for jobs to be done theory?

it is pretty intuitive for design & engineering people but can be a challenge for marketing

Apple does well: valuing less the needs of the buyer (enterprise) than the needs of the user
