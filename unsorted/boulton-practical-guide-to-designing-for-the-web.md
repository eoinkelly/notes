Part 1: Getting Started
=======================

Any medium can be defined by it's constraints
*	If you are a web designer, you need to be a web consumer

MB believes web designers have to specialize, to have a point of difference. what's mine?
	He believes you have to not forget your speciality so you can make your mark

Any time designers come up with more than one design, they will ahve a fave, the others will/might be paying lip service to the process
MB recommends devs sit next to designers working on the same problem
MB feels a rigid design process is dangerous for agencies; If every design problem is different then the same process might not be best each time. I guess designing the process could be seen as the first design task

consider charging up front or giving a small discount if they pay up front?
Remember that we are in the customer service industry!!
he has a 1 month, 3 month and 6 month todo list to separate goals


Part 2: Research & Ideas
========================

brief =
	aims & objectives
	+ deliverables = documents, content, sketches
		= stuff they give us + stuff we give them

	+ expectations =

'creative' is a document produced by the desinger in response to the client brief





research is vital to the success of any design project
other stuff
[this is incomplete]


Primary research = new research
Secondary research = new analysis of old data

Visual research:
	gathering visual information (sketchbooks, mood boards) used for solving design problems
	See Flickr typography pool http://www.flickr.com/groups/type/

	The purpose of research is to provide insight - it is not an end in itself
	Use SWOT on the current site to start generating ideas
	Try to sum up the goal of the project in one sentence - this is "The idea brief".

Part 3 Typography
==================

95% of the web is typeography
Aside
	Keep verdana under 11px for best results

Areas to study:
	letter anatomy
	type classification


Type classification

1.	Serif vs. Sans-serif
	Serifs can be:
	* 	Bracketed
	*	Hairline
	*	Flare
	*	Slab
2. Contrast Vs. Whitespace
	Contast = stroke thickness
	High contast = thick strokes, closed counters
	Low contrast = thin strokes, open counters
	Can also think of it as the % of black vs white in the em square
3.	Stress direction of the stroke weight
	More stress = more acute angle of stroke weight
4.	Weight = thickness of the stroke e.g. light, medium, bold, black

Deutshe Nomenschuss(sp?) Typeface Classification (10 types):

1.	Graphic
	Gothic, blackletter, textural
2.	Humanist
	15th century manuscripts
3.	Garalde
	Based on handwriting in italy
4. 	Transitional
	Lighter than garalde
5.	Didone
6.	Slab Serif
	Egyptian
7.	Lineale
	Sub categories are:
	1.	Humanist
	2.	Grotesque
	3.	Neo-grotesque
	4.	Geometric
8.	Glypics
	Stone carving based
9.	Script
10.	Stylised
	A mixed bag of stuff that doesn't fit into the other categories

In the old days type had names
10pt 	=	garamond
7pt		=	minion
12pt	=	pica

Aside: CSS font size names are not consistent ratios up and down

x-small x0.66
small x0.66
normal x0.66
large x1.5
x-large x1.5

Photshop default fonts zies are a traditional scale (really? or are they all notes on the keyboard?)

Choosing Type Sizes
---------------------
*	The 6pt -> 72pt scale is traditional. Do not create arbitrary font sizes without good reason
*	The type sizes you choose should have a relationship to each other

Choosing Style & Weight
-----------------------

A typeface can have many weights
*	Core Weights:
	*	Roman
	*	Italic
	*	Bold
	*	Bold Italic
	*	Small Caps
* Extra weights:
	*	Thin
	*	Extra Bold
	*	Black
	*	Condensed
	*	{others possible here too}

Why use different weights?

*	Aesthetic problem; Using a new weight to add style or solve a visual or compositional problem
*	Content problem; Content dictates a new weight or "voice" e.g. a quote, change in tone of voice, etc.

Aside: italics set in romans is a relatively new idea.

There are rules that govern the choice of weight. {see boulton diagram of how to get from one weight to another}

1 pt = 1/72 inch
1 pica = 12 pts
1 em = the distance horizontally equal to the type size
	1 em of 12pt type is 12pt
	em is a relative measurement
1 ex = a CSS measurement = x-height of characters but in reality = 1/2 em as the x-height is not embedded in most fonts

Line Lenght = the measure
	Optimimum line lenght for legibililty is 2-3 alphabets (52-78 characthers including spaces)

Leading
*	Rule: your leading should always be greater than your word spacing
*	A longer measure requires increased leading for legibility
*	White text on black is higher contrast so increase leading and tracking & reduce font-weight to compensate
*	All type in a document can be aligned to the leading values of the main content - this is aligning to the baseline grid
*	Leading can have fractional values of the baseline grid - this is called "incremental leading" e.g. a sidebar with smaller type might align to every 5th baseline of the main content. Using the main-content's baseline grid for the type on the side would look odd.



Part 4
==============

Color theory has three areas of study

1.	Scientific
	This intersects with web accessibility
2. 	Artistic
	Boulton deals mostly with this
3. 	Pcychological

Additive Primary Colors (Hues):

*	Red
*	Blue
*	Green

Subtractive Primary Colors (Hues):

*	Cyan
*	Yellow
*	Magenta

Black is added for printing

Secondary color = created by mixing two primary hues (3 seconandary colors)
Tertiary color = created by mixing a secondary and a primary (6 tertiary colors)

The color wheel has 12 hues; 3 primary, 3 secondary, 6 tertiary.

Monochrome = one color from the wheel
Complementary = color opposite to each other on the color wheel
	They can be vibrant but also a bit horrible
Triads = 3 colors equidistant on the color wheel
	All 3 colors contrast with each other so they can clash and this is where the tension is created.
	They provide tension.
Other color wheel selectionss (MB uses these rarely)
	Analogous
		Sit immediately adjacent on either side of a selected color on the wheel
	Mutual Complements
	Near Complements
	Double Complements

Colors, when selected from the color wheel in certain combinations, interact together. The ways colors interact is the basis of color palettes.

A color = a combination of hue, saturation, brightness

Hue
	refers to a specific tone of color
	It is not another name for color as color can have saturation and brightness as well as hue
	A hue can be any *tone* or *shade* of any color on the color wheel

Saturation
	refers to the purity, or intensity of a color
	It is the intensity of the hue from grey
	At maximum saturation a color contains no grey at all.
	At minimum saturation a color contains mostly grey.

Brightness
	refers to how much white or black is contained within a color.

Increasing brightness is *not* the same as decreasing saturation!
	Decreasing saturation turns the colors into shades of grey
	Increasing brightness turns the hue lighter without making it grey


It is very difficult/maybe impossible to not have a personal reaction color
colors provoke response through curlturla or personal experience - understanding these experiences helps us create color combinations that tell a story. Color theory allows us to create designs that tell a story.

Palettes & Presenting Palettes
------------------------------

MB used a big disc for the subordinate with a small disc for the accent color and a pie slice for the dominant color to present the palette

1.	Subordinate, or base color
	*	A visually weak or subordinate color. It should contrast or compliment.
2.	Dominant or main color.
	This color defines the communicative values of the combination
3.	Accent/highlight color
	This color can be sympathetic or subordinate *or* dominant color. Or you can choose one that is strong and visually striking and appears to compete with the dominant color - this can create tension

What do the individual colors symbolise?
-----------------------------------------

This depends greatly on cultural norms e.g.
*	white = mourning in the east, black = mourning in the west
*	red = fire, anger, danger in the west, red = pure, divine, wealth in the east

*	Red
*	Green
*	Blue
*	Yellow
*	Orange
*	Brown
*	Black
*	White

*	MB recommends begining the design process in grey and add color later as it avoids our natural biases about colour, lets you make your site more visually accessible.
*	Be careful color coding sub-sites as you can easily run out of colors

{I need to re-read the color section to get the message}

Layout
============

*	Liquid/Fluid layout uses % of viewport width for widths
*	Elastic layout uses ems for width
		widths are based on the size of the text
		e is for em and also elastic
*	Fixed width use pixels for width

golden section = golden ratio = divine proportion = 1:1.618 = derived from pi

*	If a design "feels" right, it probably is right
*	The rule of thirds is a simplificaiton of the golden section

Looking Room
	* 	the space between the subject and the edge of the screen
	*	the negative space on the side the subject is looking or moving towards

Art Direction
	*	The act or process of managing the visual presentation of content.
	*	Difficult to do on the web as content and presentation are often separate

Compositional Tools
	* Rule of thirds
	* Da Vinci triangle
	* Looking Room

	These should aid composition but not be evident in the designs themselves.

3 Types of Shape
----------------

1.	Geometric
		circles, squoared, diamonds, rectangles
2.	Natural
		derived from nature
3.	Abstract
		expressionistic
			convey meaning or emotion
		impressionistic
			meant to represent something else

Typographic colour
------------------
*	refers to the type density on the page
*	too dark or too light can make the reading experience bad

White space/Negative space
--------------------------
	2 types
		Macro White Space = space between major elements in the composition
		Micro White Space = space between list items, between words & letters

Brands use extra whitespace to "tell" customers that they are sophisticated, expensive, high-quality
Conversely a lack of whitespace implies cheap

	another taxonomy for whitespace: active vs passive
		Active White Space = used to lead a reader from one element to another
			Making text bold chanes the active white space - it changes the composition to emphasise or structure information
		Passive White Space = exists to create breathing room and balance

Take away: whitespace is not just the unconsidered space bwtween things!

Grids
-----
Grids won't fix all your layout woes
MB looks for a fixed element from the brief from which to derive the grid
	could be screen resolution (such as you can guess at it)
	could be an image size

	This makes sense as it makes it easy to accommodate the fixed part of the brief

An advantage of elastic (em based) grids is that they have a natural relationship to the type on the page

wireframes: use grey box for images, blue text for links, black text for body copy

It's ok to break your grid system sometimes! you can provide great emphasis by having an element "misplaced" on the grid

Design from the content out - audit old site to see what content you need to create
