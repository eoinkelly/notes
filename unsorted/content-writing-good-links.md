writing good link text
----------------------

words are powerful-use them carefully
write links like you would write a heading - use 8 words or less
write the link as if it is the only hting a customer will see
describe the task or benefit of the link
lead with the need
treat links as steps in a task
    thinking linking is about thinking task completion
    make sure all the links in the task path work well
group all *related* navigation links together on the page if possible
    don't make the user search for other links
don't use "infinity and beyond" links like 'Resources' or 'Tools'
    these are like websites within websites
never use "quick links" - are the other ones slow? same goes for 'useful links' - are the others useless?
only add surrounding text if absolutely necessary
a link is a signpost
    it should
        instantly communicated itself as a signpost
        should not draw attention to itself - it is all about the destination

link text should not be just the fileformat e.g. <a href="">PDF</a>
but you can put the filetype and even size to let people know what they are getting
    <a href="">Installation instructions (PDF, 2.3MB)</a>

link text forces us to think about the outcome rather than the input
write your link text based on what the customer is trying to do *next*!
