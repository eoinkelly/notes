the files are just artifacts to help me refresh the info in my head (my "knowledge in the world")
there shoud only be one place for me to look to find out everything I know about a topic - too hard otherwise


google docs is better for some types of notes - how do i have it in both places?
	option: make the text file the master and refer to the google docs (have a references section?)
	option: use a naming scheme for both (doesn't stop me forgetting the other bits exist tho or knowing that i have a map to all the stuff)
	option

i definitely need 1 and only 1 master file for each project
master files may contain private info so they can be local - the shared stuff is a subset of the master stuff




google docs
+ notes are more readable straight away, easy to print
? how often do I print?
- slightly slower to create?
+ available immediately from any computer
- less "codey"
+ easier to add color, embed images etc
- easier to control formatting encourages me to fuck around with the formatting.

- I feel less of a "developer" if i use it rather than my fancy text editor

text files
+ more "codey"
+ quick text manipulation tools
- more fiddly to create
