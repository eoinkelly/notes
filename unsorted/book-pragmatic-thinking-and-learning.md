Dreyfus Model of skill acquisistion
===================================

AH defines "experience" as performing this skill results in a change in thinking.

0. Unskilled and unaware of it
	* You don't know how much you don't know.
	* Sometimes called "second order incompetence"

1. Novice
	* need context-free rules
	* novices will not necessairly know which rules are most relevant in a given situation.
	* can't handle errors that they don't have a context-free recipe for. unfortunately you cannot specify everything fully.
	* so these rules should be the "enough to get you started" vibe, not a "this is all you need to know"
	* they want to perform a task, they don't necessairly want to learn
	* rules can get you started but they won't carry you further

2. Advanced Beginner
	* advanced beginners don't want the big picture. They have no holistic understanding and don't want it yet.

3. Competent
	* competents can now develop conceptual models of the problem domain and work with these effectively
	* they can begin to solve problems they have not encountered before.
	* they can begin to seek out and apply advice from experts and apply it.
	* AH believes that even at this level, the programmer isn't able to follow agile techniques effectively

4. Proficient
	* They need the big picture. They will be annoyed by oversimplified information
	* Proficient practitioners can self-correct. They can *reflect* on previous task performance and revise their approach to do better next time. AH believes that this simply isn't available until you get to this level.
	* Can apply maxims: truths that have to be applied in a particular context. E.g. "test everything that can possibly break". Lower levels might not be able to distinguish between what can break and what is *likely* to break even!
	* The advice in The Pragmatic Programmer is in the form of maxims.
	* The GoF patterns book is also aimed at this level. AH believes that you need to be at this level to use patterns - lower levels confuse them with recipes!
	* Proficient practitioners can take full advantage of the reflection and feedback that is core to agile methods

5. Expert

	* context is key to becoming an expert
	* they are the primary sources of knowledge in a field.
	* Experts work from intuition, not from reason.
	* They may be unable to articulate as to how they arrived at a conclusion - it just "felt right".
	* The expert knows the difference between irrevelenat and important details but perhaps not on a conscious level. They know which details to focus on and which to ignore, they are very good at targetted, focused pattern matching.
	* Experts aren't perfect
	* Forcing an expert to follow rules can ruin their expertise. So trying to apply "iron clad" rules to all members of a team will rob you of your advantage.

AH: Agile development is a very effective tool but it won't work on a team composed solely of novices and advanced beginners.

"Practices can never be completely objectified or formalized because they must ever be worked out anew in particular relationships and in real time."

The journey from novie to expert:

* moving from rules to intuition
* a change in perception where a problem is no longer a collection of equally relevant bits but a complete and unique whole where only certain bits are relevant.
* Finally a change from beign a detached observer to being an involved part of the system itself

The journey from novice to expert involves changes in my brain!



As soon as you focus on a goal, L-mode thinking begins to dominate. To cultivate R-mode thinking, you need to cultivate a style of non-goal-directed thinking.
* Source code is write-once, read many so it's worth making it as human readable as possible.

* When debugging a tricky bug, instead of trying to find the cause, try to come up with 3 or 4 ways of causing it. this can turn the problem on it's head and help your R-mode thinking

Chap 6 Learning
===============

* Mastering knowledge alone without expeience isn't effective
* A random approach without goals or feedback tends to give random results

Examples of visions:
"learn erlang"
"lose weight"

These aren't specific enough to take action on - we need SMART goals!

SMART
-----

* Specific
	* Narrow the vision down to something concrete, a next action
* Measurable
	* How will I know when I'm done?
	* goes hand in had with specific - if I can't figure out how to measure it, its probably not specific enough
	* I don't have to see the final destination or everything I will pass along the way, I just have to see a few feet in front of me (like driving at night)
* Achieveable
	* Is the goal realistic under any reasonable set of circumstances
	* Some goals are possible but would require a disproportionate commitment of time and resources
	* "Is this goal achieveable from where I am *now*"
* Relevant
	* Is this something that both *matters* to me and *is under my control*?
	* If it's not under my control it's not relevant
* Time-boxed
	* Perhaps the most important one - I need to give myself a deadline
	* Take small bits, give myself frequent, small deadlines

Does this goal make sense in the larger context of my life (this extends attainability and relevance). This larger context includes:

* Family
* Business
* Financial
* Community
* Environment

Managing a Knowledge Portfolio
------------------------------

* Consider my skills and talents as a *knowledge portfolio*
* Like a financial or artistic portfolio it must be managed - this is a skill I can learn.
* Having a *learning plan* and sticking to it will give me much more value in return than ad-hoc learning (even though there is some advantage in *any* learning)

### How to maintain my knowledge portfolio

1. Have a concrete plan
	* Use SMART goals
* Devise different levels of goals over time e.g. now, next month, next 6 mons etc.
2. Diversify knowledge investment for success
	* What is the risk vs. return ratio of this investment?
3. Make an active, not passive, investment
4. Make a regular investment
