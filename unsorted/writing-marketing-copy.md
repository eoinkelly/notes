# Writing Marketing Copy
We often make the mistake of writing our material to be all about the brand rather than the benefits that we offer to our consumers.

Our materials should persuade our prospects and inform them that we have something valuable to offer them. 
Note that we have to "inform" and "persuade"

# 5 questions to assess my marketing copy (this could be improved i think)
1: Are you defining the nature of your product and/or service and citing all the features that would be of interest to the prospective consumer? 
2: Have you positioned your product and/or service to define clearly why you are different from your competitor? Have you touched on the pain-points that your product and/or service eases? Why do they need you? 
3: Did you write your market material with your target audience in mind? Do not write your collateral without doing a demographic study of your prospects. 
4: Is your collateral easy to understand? Does it flow smoothly and rapidly without causing confusion? Does it contain a friendly and extroverted tone? Is it uncluttered, persuasive and involving? 
5: Can your sales team distribute the material and know that it will peak the interest of your prospect or will it lose them in the egotistical paragraphs regarding your companies status and brand rather than the benefits that you have to offer them?
