Can I delegate?
Is there someone else who has (or can be given) the necessary information or expertise to complete the task?
Does the task provide an opportunity to grow and develop another person’s skills? 
Is this a task that will recur, in a similar form, in the future? 
Do you have enough time to delegate the job effectively? Time must be available for adequate training, for questions and answers, for opportunities to check progress, and for rework if that is necessary.
Is this a task that I should delegate? Tasks critical for long-term success (for example, recruiting the right people for your team) genuinely do need your attention.


Should I delegate
The project’s timelines/deadlines.
How much time is there available to do the job?
Is there time to redo the job if it’s not done properly the first time?
What are the consequences of not completing the job on time?
Your expectations or goals for the project or task(s), including:
How important is it that the results are of the highest possible quality?
Is an "adequate" result good enough?
Would a failure be crucial?
How much would failure impact other things?
o Whom Should You Delegate?
 
The factors to consider here include:
 
The experience, knowledge and skills of the individual as they apply to the delegated task.
What knowledge, skills and attitude does the person already have?
Do you have time and resources to provide any training needed?
 
The individual’s preferred work style.
How independent is the person?
What does he or she want from his or her job?
What are his or her long-term goals and interest, and how do these align with the work proposed?
 
The current workload of this person.
Does the person have time to take on more work?
Will you delegating this task require reshuffling of other responsibilities and workloads?

How to delegate
Clearly articulate the desired outcome. Begin with the end in mind and specify the desired results. 
Clearly identify constraints and boundaries. Where are the lines of authority, responsibility and accountability? Should the person:

Wait to be told what to do?
Ask what to do?
Recommend what should be done, and then act?
Act, and then report results immediately?
Initiate action, and then report periodically?
 
Where possible, include people in the delegation process. Empower them to decide what tasks are to be delegated to them and when. 
 
Match the amount of responsibility with the amount of authority. Understand that you can delegate some responsibility, however you can’t delegate away ultimate accountability. The buck stops with you!
 
Delegate to the lowest possible organizational level. The people who are closest to the work are best suited for the task, because they have the most intimate knowledge of the detail of everyday work. This also increases workplace efficiency, and helps to develop people. 
 
Provide adequate support, and be available to answer questions. Ensure the project’s success through ongoing communication and monitoring as well as provision of resources and credit. 
 
Focus on results. Concern yourself with what is accomplished, rather than detailing how the work should be done: Your way is not necessarily the only or even the best way! Allow the person to control his or her own methods and processes. This facilitates success and trust. 
 
Avoid “upward delegation”. If there is a problem, don’t allow the person to shift responsibility for the task back to you: ask for recommended solutions; and don’t simply provide an answer.
