Facebook Marketing for Dummies Book Notes
=========================================

I agree that what matters is understanding the nature of 'social media'. We are in the midst of a massive shift to a 'many-to-many' communication paradigm and unprecedented consumer empowerment.

What's important is using these tools to build authentic relationships and communities. The particular strategy will vary depending on your business. The technologies are constantly changing.

Social writing is a unique skill because the writing needs to be conversa-
tional. Headlines need to be provocative and entice the reader into wanting
to know more. Above all, body copy needs to have a colloquial tone without
a trace of sales- or marketingspeak. Most people tend to think they can use the same
writing resource for research papers, fact sheets, brochures, website copy,
e-mail copy, and social content. This is a dangerous practice. Having someone
who truly understands the medium can help tailor existing content, and writing
new content helps to ensure that you always put your best foot forward


Facebook advertising vs facebook marketing

talk about the types of marketing that facebook allows you to do - explain that these didn’t start with facebook
can deelop a community around your brand

Give them a good reading list of books to understand the “strategy” level picture

split the doc up into strategy and tactics?

don’t make it a list of the things they can do - pick the 3 most important at “beginner” level and start there

give facebook stats
num people on there now:
avg time they spend on there


business goals you can fulfill on FB
increase awareness of your brand
get to know your customers
increase sales with coupons, group deals etc.
launch prodcuts
do customer service on there
actually sell stuff on there (zipcar etc)

getting them to ‘like’ your page is just the first step - you then have to grow the relationship - you have to use your page to enhance the benefit that your customers get from doing business with you e.g. car dealr who posts tips on car maintenance as well as special offers

Your Audience
they have strong-ties and weak-ties between them

The marketing funnel levels
Awareness - FB ads and friend networks
Consideration - give them proof, testimonials, garuantees (to move them to next level)
Conversion - monitor FB wall for buyers remorse and other customer feedback
Loyalty
Advocacy - these are gold: give them offers, discounts etc.
you might use different strategies for customers at each level


Know your audience
Of all your customers, think about the ones who keep coming back — the
ones who consistently tell others about your business. Wouldn’t it be great
to attract more of these types of customers?

From this perspective, you can begin to define your target audience as “the
ideal person who you want to get your product or service in front of.” It
shares essentially the same characteristics as your best customers.

Come up with personas of your target audiences - use them to inform your marketing

Personas are your marketing campaign’s imaginary friends.
Playing with imaginary friends helps kids learn to interact with real people.
Your personas will teach you to interact with a real audience. Think of a
persona as an imaginary character that represents a member of your tar-
geted demographic.

You can develop personas by following these basic steps:
1. Figure out who your customers are (by defining their needs, demo-
graphics, income, occupation, education, gender; do they volunteer,
how much do they donate, and so on).
2. Create groups of customers that share a lot of the same characteristics.
Include groups for new customers and repeat customers to help you
understand why people buy from you in the first place, and why they
come back to buy again.
3. Rank these groups in order of importance.
 Home Depot, for instance, might rank professional builders higher than
first-time DIYers.
4. Invent fictional characters that represent each group. Add details
such as age, occupation, marital status, kids, hobbies, interests, online
activity, and more. Anyone who directly connects with your custom-
ers on a daily basis should be brought into this discussion (salespeople,
tech support people, and so on).
5. Give these characters life by using a stock photo of an actual person
and naming him.
 This also makes it easier to create products and messaging that speak to
this person. It might be tempting to skip this step, but don’t. The more
real you can make your personas, the more compelling your marketing
will be.
6. Finally, create a short back story for each persona.
 For example, a food pantry might have the following story for “Beth,”
one of its volunteer person

Traditional marketing methods like print or TV ads are limited in that they
can only shout at, so to speak, your customers to get them to buy something.


Create a marketing plan
Before you can take full advantage of the marketing power of Facebook, you
need to put together a Facebook marketing plan, which is a structured way
to align your strategies with your objectives. Here are the general steps for
creating your plan:
1. Develop your value proposition. why is your company different from the opposition and why should customers spend money with you. you might have a different value propositoin for each audience you target. To develop your value proposition(s) ask yourself:
How are you differetn to your competitors?
What value do you provide ot your stakeholders
what are your big-picture goals
2. Understand your audience. what are their culture, view-points? where do they spend their time, what information sources do they use/trust? what motivates them?
3. Define your marketing goals. What do YOU want out of this? the 4 most common are
build brand awareness
drive sales
form a community of people who share your values - takes a long time
listen to feedback about your brand
4. Develop a content strategy.
5. Monitor and measure your Page activities.
6. Integrate your online and offline campaigns.


Understanding your fans’ psychographic profiles is an important element in
knowing who they are. Psychographic variables (such as music a user loves,
politicians he endorses, or causes he supports) are any qualities relating to
a user’s personality, values, attitudes, interests, or lifestyles. These variables
are in contrast with demographic variables (such as age and gender) and
behavioral variables (such as usage rate or loyalty) and can help you better
understand your customer segments.

The culture of Facebook is formed by young, digitally fluent adults who under-
stand when they’re being talked at versus engaged in a conversation. So the
key isn’t to interrupt them with a continuous stream of messages, but to
instead use content to encourage participation. By creating a steady stream of
rich content, you can engage the right audience and get them to interact with
your brand.

The
number of people who like your Page aren’t worth anything to your business
if you can’t peel away the layers to gain greater meaning into their actions.
You need to translate those analytics into real-world lessons that you then
apply to your content. If you don’t see any performance changes, it might be
time to rethink your content strategy.

The "Launch"
=============
preparation - make sure the page is ready
	images, avatars, applications, initial content
		 Pick a good name for your Page. You can boost your search engine
	rankings by choosing a Page title that includes your brand.
	 ✓ Display an attractive avatar or main image that reflects your brand.
	 ✓ Set a custom welcome tab as your default tab. Remember, having a
	custom welcome tab greatly increases your fan conversion rates.
	 ✓ Remove any tabs you’re not using.
	 ✓ Create a short URL at http://facebook.com/username.
	 ✓ Add a few posts to your Page. That gives new fans something to engage
	with once they arrive.

seed likes - plan other marketing activities to get it off the ground
	your page must have content that fans can like and engage with so that the page gets promoted to their friends
	send email ot your lists
		 Keep the focus on the value to the recipient, not your business.
		 Write the e-mail in the second person, using you and yours to speak
		directly to the customer.
		 Present the benefits in a concise list of bulleted items.
		 Tell recipients that they’ll meet others on the Page with similar interests
		and ideas. This way, they’ll feel like they’re joining a community, and not
		just another Facebook Page.

	add it to your email signature
	use the FB 'suggest a page' to promot the page amongst your existing friend networks
	announce to existing customers
	leverage existing marketing assets

second-stage thrust (rocket analogy)
	use ads on your likers to target their friends presumabley w. similar interests
	cross promotional campaigns
	keep content fresh and creative

Here are a few questions you should consider to help set your Facebook Page
apart from your other marketing channels:
 ✓ How can you bring your business’s unique voice to life in a compelling
and personal way?
 ✓ In what specific ways do your current customers like to connect with your
business? What content do they find useful, valuable, or interesting?
 ✓ In addition to building awareness for your business, how important is it
for you to use Facebook to drive sales?
The clearer you are about the answers to these questions, the clearer your
brand messaging will be to Facebook users.


by linking to your blog postes from your publicly indexable facebook page you are giving the blog google juice - the links should have relevant keywords etc.

Chapter 8: engagement

networking on facebook is like networking in real life - it's not just quantity of interactions, it's quality too
	we want quality content and quality *conversations*
quality =
	value for them i.e. useful content, solutions etc.

we want to generate content and start conversations ("engagement" = both of those things)

	generate good content
		useful, provides value to the customers
		maybe solves a problem for them?
		makes you memorable
		means you aren't viewed as an annoying interruption
		perople are still poeple even online-there are no shortcusts to building relationships - it takes time & effort

	motivate them to talk to your business
	trust you enough to tell you when they have a problem or why they love what you do

	2 reasons you want fans to interact with a page
		you can build a relationship with them through dialog and discussion
		the more activity generated onyour page, the more stories will be published to your fan's news feeds
		which drives more awareness to the original action and creates viral marketing

	ALways stay on message - make sure the content relates to the business in some way
	Keep links positive side - no need to associate negative news with your business.

	why do people engage with businesses on facebook
		they feel like they are being heard! whether they have a problem or a compliment they want to be heard!

	real engagement with fans grows over long periods of time so don't bother tracking daily changes

	use posting as the page and posting as a person to distinguish brand voice from a personal voice
	be careful posting as your page to another page's wall - it might be seen as spam if that community
	doesn't know you ro doesn't trust you.

	you can @ mention other pages in your posts to cross-promote them

	What makes great status updates?

		*	shorter text updates get more engagement-don't shite on too much.
		*	posting outside normal business hours can increase engagement
			*	helps get you to the top of the newsfeeds
		*	posting updates at the end of the week helps engagement
			*	see the 'happiness index'
		*	Photos & videos can say a lot
			*	always include title and comment on a photo
		*	don't over-sell or undersell!
		*	always be civilized

		Conversation Starters
		*	Aks yes/no or true/false questions - less brain power required to reply
		*	Ask fans to comment about photo you shared
		*	Poll questions
		*	Fill in the blank questions
		*	Attendance questions - ask who is attending an event, can ask fans located geographically near an event
		*	Ask for tips from fans
		*	Ask for favourite moments

		Almost always respond to comments and likes - they have invested some time and energy in you, don't fob them off now.
		There are times when it would be best not to respond e.g. irate customer who will not be satisfied
		*	if it was a mistake on your part, respond and correct the situation quickly
		*	If somebody leaves a negative comment about something that never took place or with incorrect facts, correct them.
		*	don't engage in a fight you can't win
		*	Don't let anger derail your response.

dealing wiht irate fans
 Honestly consider his point and try to find something (anything) to
agree with. Finding and establishing common ground is a great way to
get the conversation back on track.
 ✓ Correct factual inaccuracies in a very tactful and pleasant way. The
fan may not have all the data, which could be causing him to be irate.
 ✓ If you don’t know the solution to a particular situation, don’t bluff
your way out of it. Be honest, commit to finding out more, and give the
fan a date when you’ll get back to him.
 ✓ Don’t forget that you can always take your conversation offline.

Understand why people share - "sharing personas"



The Facebook Marketing Book
==========================

A well-thought-out content strategy is the only way to approach
Facebook marketing and not drive yourself (and Page members)
crazy. It’s tempting to just post whatever strikes you that day,
but this can quickly become overwhelming, especially when you
are competing for attention in a crowded newsfeed

What are you trying to do on Facebook?
	Engage people who currently prefer and use your brand
	Attract new page members who already use your servcie but don't know you are on Facebook
	Sell your product?
	Generate leads?

Most people on facebook are not receptive to sales pitches - you need to follow the etiquitte
-that means posting quality information that matches the frequency and style of Facebook

Set patterns and common topics for your content
Create a content calendar to stay organised and meet your goals - can be as simple and complex as you need
also lets you aovide repitition of content - you can also use it to overlay on top of revenue graphs etc. to spot trends

can put SEO keywords in
	page url
	info box
	page name

If used properly, Facebook can be an extension of your brand,
helping you present the same personality, tone, and visual face
as you would in any other material.
