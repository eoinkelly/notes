## ProGuard

_proguard is not run by default in cordova projects_

- shrinks
    - removes unused code
- optimizes
    - removes unused code
- obfucates
    - renames classes, fields, methods with obscure names

- results in a smaller APK that is harder to reverse engineer
- integrates into the android build system
- only runs when you build in release mode
- ProGuard does not run in debug mode because it makes debugging harder.
- is optional but recommended
- is controlled by `proguard.cfg` in project root

- To enable proguard
    - set the `proguard.config` property in your `project.properties` file

```
// project.properties
proguard.config=proguard.cfg

// if not in project root
// proguard.config=/path/to/proguard.cfg
```

There are 3 ways of building an android project in release mode Build in release
mode using

1. `ant release`
    - Any build in _release mode_ will run proguard if it is set in
      `project.properties`
    - output files in `bin/proguard/`
2. Eclipse export wizard
    - Any build in _release mode_ will run proguard if it is set in
      `project.properties`
    - output files in `proguard/`
3. Using gradle (in AndroidStudio)
    - To use ProGuard with gradle you need to add it to your `gradle.build`
      file's build types

ProGuard outputs 4 files when it runs:

- dump.txt
    - describes the internal class structure of the apk
- mapping.txt
    - basically a sourcemap of the orignal code to new code
    - you need this if you want to decode stack traces you get from customers
      using the obfuscated build.
- seeds.txt
    - classes and members that are not obfuscated
- usage.txt
    - list the code that was stripped from the apk

Where they are put depends on build system

## ant

## gradle

- Run the `gradle` command from a dir that has a `build.gradle` file

- gradle tasks <---> ant targets

## jarsigner

# zipalign
