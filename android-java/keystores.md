# ~/.android/debug.keystore

- a "Java KeyStore" file
- installed by the android SDK tools
- the keystore itself has a password and any private keys in it also have
  passwords
- this file is the debug keystore so it has a known password so you don't have
  to mess with signing while in dev mode
- it seems you can do "read" operations to a keystore without providing its
  password
- default settings for the debug keystore
    ```
    Keystore name: "debug.keystore"
    Keystore password: "android"
    Key alias: "androiddebugkey"
    Key password: "android"
    CN: "CN=Android Debug,O=Android,C=US"
    ```
- Accordign to SO this will manually rebuild a keystore
    ```
    keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -storepass android -alias androiddebugkey -keypass android -dname "CN=Android Debug,O=Android,C=US"
    ```

To inspect a keystore:

```
# it seems you can list the contents of a keystore if you don't give a password
# (you just get a warning)

$ keytool  -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -list
Enter keystore password:

Keystore type: JKS
Keystore provider: SUN

Your keystore contains 1 entry
