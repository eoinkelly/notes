# Gradle

A gradle build is controlled by _more than one_ `build.gradle` file

- is a DSL built on top of Groovy
    - groovy is interpreted (interpreter runs from a .jar file)
    - implications:
        - your gradle files are not just static declarations - they are also
          runnable code
- does not do compiling/linking/packaging itself but directs other tools in how
  to do it

Alternatives

- Ant
- Maven
- make
- rake

~/.gradle/ has stuff

gradle seems to be started from a sh script that basically loads

> CLASSPATH=$APP_HOME/lib/gradle-launcher-2.2.1.jar

# For android

currently android studio comes with gradle 2.2.1 currently brew has 2.2.3

Seesm to be started by a wrapper script that is in the sdk/tools dir

Android studio comes iwth a copy of gradle

    /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/gradle/gradle-2.2.1

but there is an option to run it from a wrapper script

> the project-level Gradle file uses buildscript to define the Gradle
> repositories and dependencies. This allows different projects to use different
> Gradle versions. Supported repositories include JCenter, Maven Central, or
> Ivy.
