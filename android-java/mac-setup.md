# JDKs on my system

1. built-in jdk stuff that comes with macosx
    - /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines
2. Other JDKs I have installed
    - /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines

# Android SDKs on my system

1. ~/adt-bundle-mac-x86_64-20140702
2. /usr/local/android-dev-tools
3. ~/Library/Android/sdk

# Other Java tools on my system

- ant from brew

Categories of tools that I have:

- command line e.g. adb, cordova
    - currently using the SDK from /usr/local/android-dev-tools (see paths
      below)
    - currently using built-in OSX java, javac
- eclipse
    - currently using built-in OSX java, javac
    - is using SDK from `/Users/eoinkelly/adt-bundle-mac-x86_64-20140702/sdk`
    - I _think_ eclipes does not use ANDROID_HOME if the SDK location is set in
      its preferences.
- android studio
    - had to install slightly older version of java
      (http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572) to get it to work on yosemite
    - uses ~/Library/Android/sdk as SDK location

# Environment setup for java dev

# Config places

    ~/.android/
    ~/.gradle/
    ~/.m2/ (my maven repository)

My current version is java version "1.6.0_51" this seems to be yosemite java

# Environments

## Shell

Seems to be setup to use the built-in system Java

```
$ java -version
java version "1.6.0_65"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_65-b14-466.1-11M4716)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.65-b04-466.1, mixed mode)

$ env | grep JAVA
JAVA_HOME=/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home
```

~/.zshrc export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home) export
ANDROID_HOME=/usr/local/android-dev-tools/sdk

~/.zprofile export
PATH="/usr/local/android-dev-tools/sdk/platform-tools:$PATH"
    export PATH="/usr/local/android-dev-tools/sdk/tools:$PATH"

Aside:

    # add to /etc/launchd.conf
    setenv ANDROID_HOME /path/to/android-sdk

seems to be how you set environment variables for non terminal access ??? but
that file does not exist by default on Yosemite at least ???

## Android studio

Using JDK 1.8.0_31 configured via its preferences pane
