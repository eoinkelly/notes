# Linux stat command

- comes from coreutils
- displays filesystem status
- exists as a shell builtin and standalone binary
- why use it instead of `ls`?
    - handy for shell scripts because you can control output formatting with
      format sequences
    - gives more detail than `ls` by default:
        - timestamps for atime, ctime, mtime shown with full accuracy
            - Access time (atime) when contents of file were last accessed
            - Modificaiton time (mtime) - when contents of file were last
              changed
            - Change time (ctime) - when the inode was last modified
            - Birth time - when the file was created (not well supported,
              waiting on kernel feature)
        - how many hard links exist to the file
        - what device the file lives on
        - fie size but also number of blocks it takes up and IO block size
- See below for details of how to get the file

```bash
$ ls -al .profile
-rw-r--r-- 1 deploy deploy  807 Apr  4  2018 .profile

$ stat .profile

# To actually see the file creation time we have to use this clunky interface
# * 256077 is the inode number of the file we want
# * /dev/xvda1 is the block device of the disk
#
# The file "birth" time is "crtime" in the output
#
$ sudo debugfs -R 'stat <256077>' /dev/xvda1
