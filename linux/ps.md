PROCESS STATE CODES

Here are the different values that the s, stat and state output specifiers
(header "STAT" or "S") will display to describe the state of a process:

        D    uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
        R    running or runnable (on run queue)
        S    interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
        T    stopped by job control signal
        t    stopped by debugger during the tracing
        W    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
        X    dead (should never be seen)
        Z    defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its
            parent

For BSD formats and when the stat keyword is used, additional characters may be
displayed:

        <    high-priority (not nice to other users)
        N    low-priority (nice to other users)
        L    has pages locked into memory (for real-time and custom IO)
        s    is a session leader
        l    is multi-threaded (using CLONE_THREAD, like NPTL pthreads do)
        +    is in the foreground process group

About 'I'

- It's not in the man page
- It means “idle”. This state was introduced very recently, in September 2017
  (version 4.14 of the Linux kernel). It is used for kernel threads which use
  the TASK_IDLE state when idling, instead of TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE; in previous
  versions of the kernel, such threads were reported as TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
  which was confusing.
