### Timeline

-   1949 Fender Deluxe amp
-   1951 Howlin' Wolf guitar player cranked it on _How many more years?_ to create one of the first recorded fuzz tones ever.
    -   Achieved by distorting the tube amplifier.
-   1951 Kinks
    -   Ray Davies says he stuck a knitting needle into an amp speaker
    -   Dave Davies says he (not Ray) used a razor blade
    -   Used on you really got me
-   1960 Marty Robbins - Don't worry
    -   Mixing console error created distortion on the bass
-   1962 ish
    -   Fuzz was the first kind of distortion
    -   Glenn Snoddy was at the recording of _Don't worry_ and created a box to emulated
    -   He had a friend in Kalamazoo Michigan
    -   Became the Maestro _Fuzz tone_
        -   Initially marketed at bassists but wasn't a hit, then marketed at guitarists to make guitar sound like a Tuba.
        -   _Fuzz tone_ was a failure until keith richards used it on Satisfaction.
            -   Richards used it ot mimic a horn part.
            -   This song made fuzz a hit in 1965
    -   Tone Bender
        -   Guy in england copied Fuzz tone because it's too hard to get - created the Tone Bender pedal
        -   Tweaked the _Fuzz Tone_, added more bass and sustain
        -   Tone Bender used by
            -   Yardbirds
            -   Jeff Beck
            -   Jimmy Page
-   1966 Fuzz Face
    -   Almost exact replica of _Tone Bender 1.5_
    -   Used by Hendrix
    -   1969 Big Muff - distortion fuzz-box sustainer
    -   First to market itself as "distortion"
-   1974 ish
    -   3 iconic distortion pedals were released
        -   _MXR Distortion+_
        -   _ProCo Rat_
        -   _Boss DS1_
    -   Used hard-clipping
    -   Used an op-amp instead of transistors
    -   Boss DS1 works great on loud and already dirty amps
-   1980 Marshall amps
    -   JCM 800 (8 stood for the '80s)
    -   JCM 900 (9 stood for the '90s)
    -   Some of the most iconic distortion sounds ever
-   1982 _Ibanez SD9 Sonic Distortion_
    -   Good but not popular
-   1984
    -   Electroharmonix folds and no more Big Muff for a while
-   1990's
    -   _Boss Metal Zone_ (works with clean loud amp)
    -   _DOD Supra Distortion Supreme_
-   1990's - today
    -   Many many distortions released from '90s until today
    -   JHS Angry Charlie is designed to emulate a JCM 800 type distortion

## Boost (preamp) pedals

-   Boost is a primitive effect
-   What does it do?
    -   Boost pedals exist to push tube amps into overdrive
    -   Boost make pickups louder
    -   A boost is anything which makes your guitar louder
-   Types
    1. Transparent boost
    2. Treble boost
        - Marshall amps are darker than Fender so "treble boost" pedals became popular e.g. _Range master_ pedal
        - These didn't make as much sense with american fender amps
    3. others ?
-   Lots of those pedals in the timeline section above chained stages of boost
-   Sometimes called a pre-amp
-   When you push the amp above it's headroom level then you are technically in "overdrive"
    -   So you want your guitar pickups to push the amp harder to force it into overdrive
-   Humbucker pickups are louder because it has more windings
-   But a boost pedal will also work if humbuckers are not enough
-   Echoplex units were also used as preamps (you turn off the delay and just use the unit as a boost). Used by
    -   Brian Setzer
    -   Ryan Adamas
-   Some boosts were packaged in little boxes attached to the guitar input jack
-   Some boosts have a volume expression pedal addon
-   Modern versions of boosts: (TODO: categorise them a bit more)
    -   _Daredevil silver solo_
    -   _?? Moonshot_
    -   _Keeley Java boost_
    -   _Powerdriver V2_
    -   _Red Llama_ (used by Tom Petty)
    -   _EHX Hot Tubes_
    -   _DOD 250_ (also labelled as "overdrive")
    -   _DOD FX10 Fet Boost_
    -   _Boss FA1_ (used by Edge)
    -   _Fulltone FB2_
    -   _Zvex XHO Superhardon_
    -   _Ibanez TS9 Tube screamer_ (turn drive knob down)
    -   _Klon Centaur_
        -   is a boost when used with Gain just barely on, also can be used as a high gain overdrive
    -   _Boss GE7_
        -   using a graphic equaliser pedal totally flat but just boost
        -   can be good in before your other overdrive pedal
    -   _JHS Morning Glory_
        -   based on _Blues breaker_ circuit
        -   low gain overdrive
        -   You can make it grittier by putting a boost before it
    -   [JHS Prestige](https://jhspedals.info/products/prestige)
        -   can be used as an always-on preamp or buffer, or you can crank it up to send your amp into a natural overdrive
        -   can chain these to make overdrive
    -   [JHS Haunting mids](https://jhspedals.info/products/haunting-mids)
        -   focused on pushing mid frequencies
        -   Sweepable-Mids EQ Preamp
        -   ?? a tubescreamer style circuit ??
    -   [JHS Milkman](https://jhspedals.info/products/milkman)
        -   slap echo preamp with a slap delay
        -   combo of slap delay and clean boost
        -   two fully independent effects with the boost on the right side and the slap delay on the left
        -   fully clean boost
        -   use to push your amp into natural overdrive or leave on all the time as a preamp
    -   [JHS Moonshine V2](https://jhspedals.info/products/moonshine-v2)
        -   A take on a Klon
    -   [JHS Clover](https://jhspedals.info/products/clover)
        -   based on Boss FA-1 FET (as used by U2 on Unforgettable Fire)
        -   can be a boost to put in front of dirt pedals
        -   can be just a clean boost
    -   [JHS Sweet tea](https://jhspedals.info/products/sweet-tea-v3)
        -   combined fully independent circuits for Moonshine V2 and Angry Charlie
        -   you can chain them together in one pedal - you can choose chaining order
    -   [JHS AT+](https://jhspedals.info/products/at)
        -   successor to the `@` pedal
        -   an "amp in a box" pedal
        -   Andy Timmons signature pedal
        -   An overdrive pedal which can go to distortion
        -   Andy Timmons chains boosts
        -   It is his distortion pedal with a boost you can chain into it to get more distortion
        -   Q: what category of overdrive is this?
        -   Based on a modified _Angry Charlie_ (JHS Angry Charlie is designed to emulate a JCM 800 type distortion)
        -   Has an independent **pre-**boost stage you can control with a second foot-switch
            -   You can have just the boost, just the overdrive or boost->overdrive for the most dirt
-   Chaining
    -   You can chain boost pedals to create overdrive and distortion
    -   You can tweak other pedals to be dirtier by putting a boost before them
    -   You can put boost after your overdrive to get a louder sound with same level of grit

## Amps

-   Obviously the amp dictates a lot about which overdrive is best
-   Fender amps
    -   clean
    -   mid-scooped
-   British amps
    -   darker
    -   more mid-range
-   Guitar amps from the '60s start to be designed to distort well when overdriven
    -   Before this, good distortion was an accident

## Five categories of overdrive circuit

-   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wVShbGe4pk&t=1008s
-   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wVShbGe4pk&t=324s

1. Soft clipping overdrive
    - Here since late 70's
    - The diodes are in the loop of the op-amp so they are not as rough on the signal as hard-clipping
    - Style 1: Tubescreamer style
        - Distinctive factors
        - Not transparent - boosts mids is its signature style
        - examples
            - Ibanez Tube screamer (the canonical version)
                - Great use case: single coil guitar going into clean mid-scooped amps.
                    - TS added midrange back that the amp didn't have.
                    - Fender amps are clean and mid-scooped
            - JHS Bonsai
            - Earthquaker Plumes
            - Fulltone Fulldrive
            - Boss super overdrive
    - Style 2: Bluesbreaker
        - 1990s Marshall make bluesbreaker pedal based on an old amplifier
        - is transparent - just makes dirty the signal it gets
        - Inspired:
            - Analogman King of Tone
            - BlackBox Overdrive 2
            - JHS Morning GLory
            - Wampler Pantheon
        - These are transparent unlike the tubescreamer
2. Hard clipping overdrive
    - The diodes are at the end of the circuit and are rough on the guitar signal
    - Style 1: - 1970' style overdrive bordering on distortion
        - many pedals which add EQ and it "ruins the circuit"
        - The two canonical examples (which inspired many other pedals):
            - MXR Distortion+
            - DOD Overdrive Preamp 250
        - Inspired
            - Quantum effects - quantum mystic (JHS rates the EQ on this one)
            - Fulltone OCD
    - Inspired:
        - Fulltone OCD
        - BlackBox Overdrive 2
    - Style 2: Klon Centaur style overdrive
        - A sub-category of hard clippers
        - Unique feature: Blends the clean signal in somewhat at all times
            - The fancy diodes don't matter if you don't turn it up
        - a fancy boost pedal if gain is low, a hard clipper if you turn gain up
        - Inspired
            - Wampler Tumnus
            - Mythos Mjolnir
            - Rocket Archer
            - Joyo Tauren
            - Way Huge Conspiracy Theory
    - Style N:
        - there are other styles of hard clipping TODO
3. Transistor based overdrive
    - Transistors in staging cascading
        - no op-amp soft clipping
        - no hard-clipping really either
        - works similar to how a tube amp works - things saturate and hit other things which also saturate
        - ++ lots of touch response
    - Examples
        - Boss BluesDriver (Recommended)
        - Keely - Super Phat Mod (a pedal based on a set of mods to a BluesDriver)
        - Ibanez MT-10
    - Sub-category: Amps in a box
        - A sub category of cascading transistors overdrive
        - deliberately not transparent - you want it to transform your sound
        - Examples
            - Marshall in a box
                - Box of Rock (sounds like a Marshall)
                - Wampler Plexi-Drive (sounds like a Marshall
                - JHS Charlie brown (sounds like JTM45 Marshall)
                - JHS Twin 12 (sounds like Silvertone 1484)
            - Dumble in a box
                - Vertex Ultraphonix

## Choosing overdrives

-   You have to play a bunch with your guitar and your amp - bring your guitar and amp if you can
-   You can stack overdrives
    -   e.g. Hard-clipping Klon > Light-transparent-soft-clipping
-   Humbuckers provide more midrange than single coils
    -   so maybe you don't need/want a tubescreamer with humbuckers

## Blues breaker history (amb-combo -> pedal -> pedal family)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s54Vrx9rTHY

-   Blues Breaker is
    -   A Marshall JTM-45 202 combo used on a famous album
    -   A pedal based on the combo used on a different famous album
        -   Which became the basis of a family of pedals
    -   is cousin to _Amp in a box_ pedals which try to emulate the JTM-45 Amp head
-   TImeline
    -   1960 ish
        -   First marshall based around 1959 Tweed Bassman
            -   he was going after the Bassman but ended up with something quite different because parts in England were different
        -   First marshall amplifiers were
            -   1962 JTM head
            -   then 410 Combo
            -   then 412 Combo
        -   initially targetted at bass players but guitarists loved them when loud
    -   1966
        -   clapton uses a JTM 45 212 + 1960 Les Paul on the _John Mayall and the Blues Breakers_ "beano" album
            -   from then on the JTM 45 212 is known as "the bluesbreaker"
            -   Album was recorded live, Amp was incredibly loud, bled into all the mics
    -   1991
        -   Marshall sees how popular pedals are and has a go
        -   releases 3 pedals 1. Blues Breaker - Designed to sound like the JTM-45 212 - Original release were all in black boxes. Later release was in silver and isn't as good 2. Shred Master 3. ???
        -   didn't do well so was discontinued a few years later
    -   2003
        -   Analogman releases King of Tone
            -   based on the 1991 black box Blues Breaker but is very different
                -   he was going after the Blues Breaker circuit but ended up with something quite different
                -   King of Tone is not a clone of the Blues Breaker
            -   also released _Prince of Tone_ which is just one side of the _King of Tone_
        -   _King of Tone_
            -   brought the blues breaker topology into boutique market
                -   inspired many other builders
                    -   JHS Morning Glory
                    -   Wampler Pantheon
                    -   Snouse BlackBox
                    -   Keely 1962
    -   2006:
        -   John Mayer released Continuum album prominently featuring the _Blues Breaker_
            -   album "brought guitar back to forefront of popular music"?
        -   _Blues Breaker_ pedal vs _Blues Breaker_ amp (Marshall JTM-45 212)
            -   Sounds fairly close from my limited experience
-   Amp in a box pedals that try to sound like the JTM-45 head (not trying to be like the _combo_, just the _head_)
    -   Rocket .45
    -   Z.vex Box of Rock
    -   LovePedal JTM
    -   JHS Charlie Brown

Bonus pedals

-   Wah pedal
-   Micro POG (Octave pedal)
-   Looper pedal

## Compression

-   If applied as a pedal, it must be placed before your drive pedals
    -   Compressors knock down loud signal and usually have tunable clean gain you add to compensate - this functionally brings up quiet things so noise/hiss from overdrives
-   It's often a difference in feel rather than sound
-   Bring loud sounds down (via the compression) and quiet sounds up (via the compensatory gain)
-   Valve amps compress
-   Compressor pedal examples
    -   Boss
    -   Dynacomp
    -   JHS Whitey Tightey
    -   JHS Pulp and Peel
-   Controls
    1. Threshold/Sustain/Sensitivity/Compression/Compression
        - the dB level at which the compressor kicks in (higher control value => lower dB setting)
    2. Attack
        - How quickly does the compressor turn on when you go over the level
    3. Release
        - How quickly does the compressor turn off
        - Q: What does the turn off curve look like?
    4. Ratio
        - How aggressively will the signal be compressed
        - 1/1 No compression (1 dB in becomes 1 dB out)
        - 2/1 Some compression
        - 3/1 More compression (3 dB in becomes 1 dB out
        - infinite
            - => acts as a limiter
    5. Blend
        - Blend the clean guitar signal with the compressed signal
    6. Volume
        - Adds clean gain to compensate for volume loss from the compression

## Amp in a box pt 2

-   As yet uncategorised by me
    -   Marshall Drive Master
    -   Marshall Shred Master
-   Marshall JCM or Plexi being pushed
    -   Vibe is darker than Fender and "british voiced"
    -   [Marshall Guv'nor](https://www.marshall.com/nz/en/product/1007075?pid=1007075)
        -   a smooth overdrive
-   Marshall JTM-45
    -   JHS Charlie Brown
        -   Replaces Tubes with FETs (this is a common approach to _amp in a box_ pedals)
        -   Think Hendrix to AC/DC
        -   Not a distortion pedal, is lighter
        -   is a transparent overdrive
        -   Cleans up like an amp if you roll volume off
        -   Works well stacked with other overdrives
        -   JTM-45 is based on Fender Bassman which is a loud clean amp so JTM-45 is not super dirty
    -   Marshall Bluesbreaker pedal
        -   modelled specifically on the Beano album sound - a JTM-45 212 Combo
-   Marshall JCM 800
    -   is the "brown sound"
    -   JHS Angry Charlie
        -   Think Van Halen to R.A.T.M.
        -   True distortion sound with lots of mids
        -   Topology is a variant of a Marshall Guv'nor
    -   JHS AT+
        -   Marshall amp in a box
        -   Same circuit topology of Angry Charlie but modified
        -   Andy Timmons tweaks on an Angry Charlie (so is a Marshall 800)
        -   Boost is a TS-808(?) style
        -   "Air" is to sort out the "air resonance frequencies" of single coil pickups in various venues. Timmons plays strats with distortion
        -   Has a toggle for 25w,50w,100w - emulating lower wattage will saturate faster
        -   Topology is a variant of a Marshall Guv'nor
        -   Controls
            -   Volume = master volume on the amp
            -   Drive = normal volume on the amp
            -   EQ = a master EQ (low to high)
            -   Air = trim the air frequency off
                -   works how?
            -   wattage (lets you control how quickly the amp will saturate and distort)
                -   100w emulates a larger cleaner amp with more headroom
                -   The regular Angry Charlie is equivalent of the 50w setting
            -   Tips
                -   move EQ up all the way and then back Air off a lot to say 10 o clock
        -   Boost
            -   a tube screamer style boost with mids
            -   Literally Andy Timon's vintage TS-808 with his settings baked in as resistors not pots
    -   Boss JB-2
        -   Dual drives pedal
        -   JB-2 Angry Driver pairs BOSS BD-2 Blues Driver with JHS Angry Charlie
-  Marshall Silver Jubilee
    -   JHS PG-14
        -   Paul Gilbert signature collaboration
        -   Can sound like a fuzzface into a Marshall
        - Distortion pedal (pink knobs, emulates Marshall Silver Jubilee ish) with a pre-amp on the front (black knobs)
-   Silvertone 60W 1484 amp
    -   [JHS Twin Twelve](https://jhspedals.info/products/twin-twelve-drive)
        -   seemingly not available anymore
        -   > In 1963 Silvertone\* introduced the 60 Watt Model 1484 guitar amplifier.
            > Originally a student model amplifier, the 1484 has since become
            > legendary, hard to find, and coveted by some of the biggest names in
            > music.
        -   Used by Beck, White Stripes, Death Cab for Cutie, Vampire Weekend, Coldplay
        -   Can be used as always-on boost or a solo booster
        -   edge of fuzz overdrive, treble boosted
-   Supro Thunderbolt
    -   Allegedly used on Stairway to Heaven
    -   Has a re-issue now https://www.suprousa.com/amplifiers/thunderbolt/
    -   JHS Superbolt
-   Soldano Super Lead Overdrive SLO-100
    -   [Wampler SLOStortion](https://www.wamplerpedals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/SLOstortion.pdf)
        -   Apparently prefers a clean high-headroom amp rather than an already distorted amp
    -   [Soldano SLO Pedal](https://www.soldano.com/products/pedals/slo-pedal/)
        -   made by Soldano so presumably pretty good?
-   Fender
    -   Vibe is clean and loud amps
-   Dumble style
    -   A series of amps modded by Dumble
    -   Hard to pin down because Dumbles' are so different
    -   JHS Moonshine is close-ish to one kind of Dumble
-   Orange amps
    -   Wampler Catapulp
        -   Discontinued

Q: Amp in a box vs pre-amp pedals. What's the deal?

## Metal pedals

Most metal players use a Tube Screamer into a distorting amp
What's the deal with pedals aimed at metal?
