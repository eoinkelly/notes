## History of Distortion

Fuzz was the first kind of distortion

1949 Fender Deluxe amp
1951 Howlin' Wolf guitar player cranked it on _How many more years?_ to create one of the first recorded fuzz tones ever.
Achieved by distorting the tube amplifier.

1951 Kinks
Ray Davies says he stuck a knitting needle into an amp speaker
Dave Davies says he (not Ray) used a razor blade
Used on you really got me

1960 Marty Robbins - Don't worry
Mixing console error created distortion on the bass

1963 ish
Glenn Snoddy(sp?) was there and created a box to emulated
He had a friend in Kalamazoo Michigan
Became the Maestro fuzz tone
Initially marketted at bassists but wasn't a hit, then marketed at guitarists to make guitar sound like a Tuba. It was a failure until keith richards used it on Satisfaction. Richards used it ot mimic a horn part.
This song made fuzz a hit in 1965
Guy in england copied this because it's too hard to get - created the Tonebender pedal
Tweaked the _Fuzz Tone_, added more bass and sustain
Tonebender used by
Yardbirds
Jeff Beck
Jimmy Page
FuzzFace in 1966
Almost exact replica of _Tone Bender 1.5_
Used by Hendrix
Guitar amps in the '60s are designed to distort well when overdriven
Before this, good distortion was an accident
1969 Big Muff - distortion fuzz-box sustainer
First to market itself as "distortion"
1978: 3 iconic distortion pedals were released
_MXR Distortion+_, _ProCo Rat_, _Boss DS1_
Used hard-clipping
Used an op-amp instead of transistors
Boss DS1 works great on loud and already dirty amps
1980 Marshall amps
JCM 800 (8 stood for the '80s)
JCM 900 (9 stood for the '90s)
Some of the most iconic distortion sounds ever
1982 _Ibanez SD9 Sonic Distortion_
Good but not popular
1990's
_Boss Metal Zone_ (works with clean loud amp)
_DOD Supra Distortion Supreme_
Many many distortions released from '90s until today

JHS Angry Charlie is designed to emulate a JCM800 type distortion

## Boost pedals

You can chain boost pedals to create overdrive and distortion
Lots of those pedals include chained stages of boost

Boost make pickups louder
Sometimes called a pre-amp
A boost is anything which makes your guitar louder

When you push the amp above it's headroom level then you are technically in "overdrive"
So you want your guitar pickups to push the amp harder to force it into overdrive
Humbucker pickups are louder because it has more windings
But a boost pedal will also work if humbuckers are not enough
Boost pedals exist to push tube amps into overdrive

Marshall amps are darker than Fender so "treble boost" pedals became popular
e.g. _Range master_ pedal
These disn't make as much sense with american fender amps
Echoplex units were also used as preamps (you turn off the delay and just use the unit as a boost). Used by
Brian Setzer
Ryan Adamas
Some boosts were packaged in little boxes attached to the guitar input jack
Some boosts were designed to be transparent boosts not treble boosts
Boost is a primitive effect
Some boosts have a volume expression pedal addon

Modern versions
_Daredevil silver solo_
_?? Moonshot_
_Keeley Java boost_
_Powerdriver V2_
_Red Llama_ (used by Tom Petty)
_EHX Hot Tubes_
_DOD 250_ (also labelled as "overdrive")
_DOD FX10 Fet Boost_
_Boss FA1_ (used by Edge)
_Fulltone FB2_
_Zvex XHO Superhardon_
_Ibanez TS9 Tube screamer_ (turn drive knob down)
_Klon Centaur_ (used with Gain just barely on, also can be used as a high gain overdrive)
_Boss GE7_ (using a graphic equaliser pedal totally flat but just boost)
can be good in before your other overdrive pedal

    _JHS Morning Glory_ low gain overdrive
        You can make it grittier by putting a boost before it
    _JHS Prestige_  (you can chain these to make overdrive)
    _JHS Haunting mids_ (focused on pushing mid frequencies)
    _JHS Milkman_ - slap echo preamp with a slap delay
    _JHS AT+_
        Andy Timmons chains boosts
        It is his distortion pedal with a boost you can chain into it to get more distortion

You can tweak other pedals to be dirtier by putting a boost before them
You can put boost after your overdrive to get a louder sound with same level of grit

## Five categories of overdrive circuit

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wVShbGe4pk&t=1008s

1. Soft clipping overdrive
    - Here since late 70's
    - The diodes are in the loop of th op-amp so they are not as rough on the signal as hard-clipping
    - Style 1: Tubescreamer style
        - Distinctive factors
        - Not transparent
        - boosts mids, is "mid heavy"
        - examples
            - Tube screamer (the canonical version)
            - JHS Bonsai - Earthquaker Plumes
            - Fulltone Fulldrive
            - Boss super overdrive
    - Style 2: Bluesbreaker
        - 1990s Marshall make bluesbreaker pedal based on old amplifier
        - Inspired:
            - Analogman King of Tone
            - BlackBox Overdrive 2
            - JHS Morning GLory
            - Wampler Pantheon
        - These are transparent unlike the tubescreamer
2. Hard clipping overdrive
    - The diodes are at the end of the circuit and are rough on the guitar signal
    - Examples (which inspired many other pedals)
        - MXR Distortion+
        - DOD Overdrive Preamp 250
    - Inspired:
        - Fulltone OCD
3. Klon Centaur style overdrive
    - A sub-category of hard clippers
    - Blends the clean signal in somewhat at all times
    - a fancy boost pedal if gain is low, a hard clipper if you turn gain up
    - Inspired
        - Wampler Tumnus
        - Rocket Archer
        - Joyo Tauren
        - Way Huge Consipracy Theory
4. Tranistor based overdrive
    - Transistors in staging cascading
    - Examples
        - Boss BluesDriver
        - Super Phat Mod (a pledal based on a set of models to a bluesdriver)
5. Amps in a box
    - A sub category of cascading transistors overdrive
    - Examples
        - Box of Rock (sounds like a Marshall)
        - Wampler Plexi Drive
        - JHS Charlie brown (sounds like JTM45 Marshall)
        - JHS Twin 12 (sounds like Silvertone 1484)

# JHS AT+

* An overdrive pedal which can go to distortion
* Andy Timmons signature pedal
* Based on a modified _Angry Charlie_
* Has an independent **pre-**boost stage you can control with a second footswitch
    * You can have just the boost, just the overdrive or boost->overdrive for the most dirt
