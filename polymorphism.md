# Polymorphism

Aside: To "parameterize" is to favour passing data into a function via function
parameters vs some other means e.g. global variables

Polymorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different
types.

A polymorphic type is one whose operations can also be applied to values of some
other type, or types.

Three types

1. Ad hoc polymorphism:
    - when a function denotes different and potentially heterogeneous
      implementations depending on a limited range of individually specified
      types and combinations.
    - Ad hoc polymorphism is supported in many languages using function
      overloading.
1. Parametric polymorphism:
    - when code is written without mention of any specific type and thus can be
      used transparently with any number of new types.
    - The concept of parametric polymorphism applies to both data types and
      functions.
    - In the object-oriented programming community, this is often known as
      generics or generic programming.
    - In the functional programming community, this is often shortened to
      polymorphism.
1. Subtyping (also called subtype polymorphism or inclusion polymorphism):
    - when a name denotes instances of many different classes related by some
      common superclass.
    - In the object-oriented programming community, this is often simply
      referred to as polymorphism.
    - Some languages employ the idea of subtyping (also called subtype
      polymorphism or inclusion polymorphism) to restrict the range of types
      that can be used in a particular case of polymorphism

Implicit type conversion has also been defined as a form of polymorphism,
referred to as "coercion polymorphism"

## Static or dynamic

- Polymorphism can be distinguished by when the implementation is selected:
  statically (at compile time) or dynamically (at run time, typically via a
  virtual function).
- This is known respectively as static dispatch and dynamic dispatch, and the
  corresponding forms of polymorphism are accordingly called static polymorphism
  and dynamic polymorphism.
