# UIView

## Overview

- Every view you see on screen is a child of `UIView`
- each `UIView` instance has an array of children in `myView.subviews`
- The parent of all views on the screen is an instance of `UIWindow` (which is
  also a child of

There are two ideas of parent-child here

1. class inheritance e.g. UIWindow inherits from UIView
    - in this heirarchy UIView is the top parent and all other views inherit
      from it
    - it seems like most views inherit **directly** from UIView
        ```
        UIView > UIWindow
        UIView > UILabelView
        UIView > UIScrollView > UICollectionView
        UIView > UIScrollView > UITableView
        UIView > UICollectionReusableView
        UIView > UIImageView
        UIView > UILabel
        UIView > UIControl > UIButton
        UIView > UIControl > UITextField
        etc.
        ```
1. view heirarachy - which views have other views in their `subviews` array
    - in this tree the UIWindow instance is at the top

How drawing tot he screen works:

- Each view renders itself onto **its own** layer (instance of `CALayer`)
    - the layer is kind of like a bitmap image
    - note that the view knows how to render itself to the its layer
- then all the bitmaps (layers) are composited together to the screen

### Stacking

- UIViews stack in a fairly predictable way
- subviews which are later in the subviews collection stack higher
- child view stack higher than their parent views

I guess it's the CALayer objects which are actually stacked?

Aside: UILabel seems to do different things when stacking parent to child - if
both parent and child are UILabel then the parent hides the child for some
reason.

### Introspection

```
v = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 100))
v.backgroundColor = UIColor.red

v.superview // a link back to the view which contains this view on the screen

v.superclass // get parent class
v.subviews
v.addSubview(otherView)
```

### Debugging

```
myView.backgroundColor = UIColor.red
```

### Point dimension

- the dimension for origins and sizes in frames is point
- a pt is a relative unit of measure
- pt is consistent across devices of different pixel resolutions

### Frames

- each view instance has a `frame` property which is an instance of CGRect
- frame
    - controls view size
    - controls view position **relative to its parent view**
- the origin point is the top left point of the rectangle
- the origin distances are relative to the origin of the parent
- the origin of the UIWindow is the _very_ top left of the screen i.e. your
  views will cover the clock and battery indicators if you position them at 0,0

```
// CGRect
//     CGSize
//         CGFloat
//         CGFloat
//     CGPoint
//         CGFloat
//         CGFloat

let r = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 100)

print(type(of: r.origin))
print(r.origin) // :: CGPoint
print(r.origin.x) // :: CGFloat
print(r.origin.y) // :: CGFloat

print(type(of: r.size))
print(r.size) // :: CGSize
print(r.size.width) // :: CGFloat
print(r.size.height) // :: CGFloat
```

### Auto resize

- Views have an `autoresize` property which does ???

### UIWindow

- Every app has one window which displays the views on the iOS device
    - you can create other windows if there is a second screen
- the window has a single "root" view controller that contains all the other
  views you add
    - this property is held in the `myWindow.rootViewController` property
    - reason for this: when you want to replace all the content on the screen
      you just change one root view contoller for another
    - => the window instance is always "on screen"

### View controllers

```
NSObject > UIResponder > UIViewController
```

A group of views is managed by a UIViewController instance

- "managed" =>
    - updating the views when content changes
    - handling user input
    - resizing views and managing layout
- you usually have many view controllers each of which owns a part of the app's
  interface
- each view controller has one "root view" associated with it (available through
  `self.view`)
    - this view is visible in the view heirarchy
- Every app contains **at least one** custom subclass of UIViewController
- storyboards let you specify your views in a GUI and wire them to their view
  controller

### How does iOS know what to load first?

#### WIthout storyboards

- You set it up manually in the `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`
  function

1. create a UIWindow instance
1. create a UIViewController instance to be the root view controller
1. assign the root view controller to your window
1. make the window visible

Example

```swift
import UIKit

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    var window: UIWindow?

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        // create a root view controller (this will actually be the root of the
        // views under the navigation controller not under window)
        var rootViewController: UIViewController!

        // create a window instance an store it in our window property
        self.window = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.main.bounds)

        // choose different root view controllers for iphone or ipad
        if UIDevice.current.userInterfaceIdiom == UIUserInterfaceIdiom.phone {
            rootViewController = ViewControllerPhone()
        } else {
            rootViewController = ViewControllerPad()
        }

        // create a navigation controller (manages a stack of view controllers) and pass the root controller we created into it
        let navigationController: UINavigationController = UINavigationController.init(rootViewController: rootViewController)

        navigationController.navigationBar.barStyle = UIBarStyle.black;
        navigationController.navigationBar.titleTextAttributes = [NSForegroundColorAttributeName: UIColor.white]
        navigationController.navigationBar.barTintColor = AppThemePrimaryColor;
        navigationController.navigationBar.isTranslucent = false


        // make the navigation controller be the root view controller
        self.window!.rootViewController = navigationController

        // show the window and make it the "key" window
        self.window!.makeKeyAndVisible()

        return true
    }

    // ... other stuff ...
}
```

#### With storyboards:

Summary: iOS loads a storyboard which in turn loads a custom subclass of
UIViewController

- In XCode you set the "Main interface" in the buid settings to a storyboard
  file
- that storyboard file has a "View Controller Scene"
- that scene has a reference to a view controller swift file which is the one
  which is loaded for that storyboard
- aside: you can edit that relationship using the RHS column in XCode and
  choosing the "Identity inspector"
