# UIWebView

_IIRC these are notes on the new webview in iOS 8+_

- has a `delegate` property
    - which is sent messages while the content is loading
    - can implement methods to talk to the UIWebView instance

- Ancestors: `UIView < UIResponder < NSObject`
- part of UIKit "framework" `#import UIKit` to get it
- conforms to 7 interfaces. These are ???

## Plugins

One instance of a plugin object is created for the life of each UIWebView

Plugins are ordinarily instantiated when first referenced by a call from
JavaScript. Otherwise they can be instantiated by setting a param named onload
to true in the config.xml file

- methods to implement (where???)
    - onReset - called when the webview is refreshed or moves to different
      screen
    - pluginInitialize - called when your plugin is initailzied action
        - this is what the javascript exec() will hit in your class

- the pattern is that JS initiates all work done on the iOS side

- messages from JS -> iOS
    - sent to the action method of the given plugin class
    - can have arbitrary num of args

- messages from iOS -> JS
    - You can use CDVPluginResult to return a variety of result types back to
      the JavaScript callbacks, using class methods
    - You can create String, Int, Double, Bool, Array, Dictionary, ArrayBuffer,
      and Multipart types. You can also leave out any arguments to send a
      status, or return an error, or even choose not to send any plugin result,
      in which case neither callback fires.
    - you seem to return an instance of CDVpluginResult that encapsulates the
      response

There doesn't seem to be a way for the iOS to send a message to JS without the
JS polling ???
