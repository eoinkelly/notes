# UIImage

- UIImage objects are immutable
    - you need to use an NSData object to get access to the underlying data e.g.
      using the UIImageJPEGRepresentation function
    - automatically purges the image data from cache if device is low on memory.
      It will automatically reload it if you ask for the image again but there
      will be a perf cost.

UIImage(imageNamed:)

- loads data from the "system cache" if it exists in there
- loads image from asset catalog _or_ main application bundle
- if the device screen has a scale other than 1.0 e.g. 2.0 this method will look
  for the given name with an "@2x" suffix on it first and fall ack to the given
  name if it fails to find that e.g. "button" will result in a search for
  "button@2x" and then "button"

```swift
UIImage(named: "somename.png") // returns image object or nil
UIImage(named: "some_asset_catalog_name") // returns image object or nil
```
