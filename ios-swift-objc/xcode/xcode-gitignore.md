# XCode

# Recommendation

Use the github starter one.

# Discussion

- Github's starter ignore
  https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Global/Xcode.gitignore
- https://gist.github.com/adamgit/3786883
    - Good comments explaining reasoning

# Cocoapods and ignoring

- Podfile.lock should NOT be ignored
- Cocoapods team recommend that you do check in Pods/ as it is slightly safer
