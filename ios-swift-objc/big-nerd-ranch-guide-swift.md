# Big nerd ranch guide to iOS development

## Chap 1

- Interface builder is an "object editor"
    - creates instances of objects and manipulates their properties
- A `.storyboard` is an archive of object instances to be loaded into memory
  when necessary

## Chap 2

- notes are in the swift playground

## Chap 3

- Views are arranged in a heirarchy
- All views are instances of `UIView`
- Each instance of UIView has a "superview" property that points at its parent
    - UIWindow is the ultimate parent of all on-screen views
- `UIWindow` has `UIView` as a superclass
- `UIWindow` is the top of the view heirarchy on the screen (not the top of the
  heirarchy in the class sense)
- Each `UIView` renderers itself to a layer (`CALayer` instance)
    - layers are composited together to build the UI
- A view has a `subviews` property which is an array of child views
    - `subviews: [UIView]`

When you initialize a view in code you use `init(frame:)` designated initializer

- the `frame` specifies the view's
    1. size
    2. position relative to the superview
- => a view is ALWAYS a rectangle

```
// pseudo-code showing how the types relate to each other
CGSize {
    width: CGFloat // points not pixels
    height: CGFloat // points not pixels
}

CGPoint {
    x: CGFloat // points not pixels
    y: CGFloat // points not pixels
}

CGRect {
    origin: CGPoint
    size: CGSize
}

UIView {
    var frame: CGRect
}


// so you can do the following
someView.frame.origin.x
someView.frame.origin.y
someView.frame.size.width
someView.frame.size.height
```

- When the application is launched, the view for the "initial view controller"
  is added to the root level window
    - this defaults to `ViewController.swift`
        - TODO: how is this chosen? I can't find a setting in xcode? is it based
          on filename?
- each instance of `ViewController` has a view property
    - the view property for the "initial view controller" is the view that will
      be shown first
- The "initial view controller" has an associated view so any views you add are
  added as subviews of that
    - => the herirarchy is `UIWindow > ViewController.view > yourView`

### Auto-layout

Autolayout allows you to describe your layout in a way that the CGRect frame of
each view can be decided by the system at runtime so it can take into account
the screen resolution, size and orientation.

- the layout is based on the "alignment rectangle"
- The frame encompasses the entire view
- the alignment rectangle encompasses that part of the view you want to use for
  layout
- Frame and alignment rectangle are often the same but not always
- the _alignment rectangle_ is based on "layout attributes"

layout attributes:

- width|height
    - width or height of the "alignment rectangle" (NOT necessairly the view!)
- top|bottom|left|right
    - the spacing between the given edge of the alignment rectangle and the
      alignment rectangle of another view in the heirarchy
- centerX|centerY
    - these determine the center point of the alignment rectangle
- baseline
    - same as "bottom" for most but not all views e.g. UITextField has baseline
      high enough so that descenders on letters like g, y don't overflow the
      alignment rectangle
- leading|trailing
    - same as left|right but will map differently depending on whether language
      is ltr or rtl

- By default every view has an alignment rectangle and every view heirarchy uses
  auto-layout
- You cannot define a view's alignment rectangle directly - you define it
  indirectly through constraints
- HINT: As a general rule of thumb you need two constraints per dimension
  (horizontal and vertical) e.g.
    - in vertical
        - top + height
        - height + bottom

Nearest neighbour views are important to understand how auto-layout works

- nearest neighbour is the closest sibling view in the specified direction
- if a view does not have any sibling views in that direction then its nearest
  neighbour is its superview (container)

UI hints about layout problems

- blue constraints = everything is fully specified
- orange constraints = misplaced view (what you see in IB is different to what
  autolayout computed)
    - you can see an orange dotted line that shows where the view should be
      according to autolayout
    - can fix it via `Resolve Auto Layout Issues > Update frames`
