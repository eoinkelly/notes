## lproj dirs

- Used for internationalisation
- Xcode has the notion of a `Base` localisation that you build your others on
  top of
- They are the folders on the filesystem that contain the localised versions of
  string files for xcode
- The UI displays each file in its context e.g. storybard stirngs file will be
  shown under the storyboard but on disk they are in the `LANG_CODE.lproj` dirs
