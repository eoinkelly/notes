## PCH files

- Called the `prefix header`
- It is _automatically included in every source file_ in the project without the
- use of compiler directives.
- They are _usually_ pre-compiled and cached to speed up build times.
    - They only have to be parsed once by the compiler
- they _can_ be used for project wide `#define` but those are a bit of a code
  smell.
- You should only `#include` headers in here that change rarely - otherwise the
  caching will be a net negative
- Downsides
    - they create a hidden dependency between your Foo.m|h files and the prefix
      header which means your source files can't be shared with other projects
      without it.
- Xcode 6 does not seem to make a PCH for new projects
