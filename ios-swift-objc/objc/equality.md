# Equality in ObjC

# ==

- test equality between two primitve C objects
- tests whether two pointers are pointing at the same object

QUESTION: == seems to work right for NSString and NSArray too - how does this
work? QUESTION:

# isEqual

- comes from NSObject
- can and should be overridden in child classes

# Testing hash keys for equality

- You can use any object as a key provided it implements `hash` and `isEqual`.
  Consequences:
    - `NSString` is a good choice:
        - `hash` and `isEqual` is based on characters in string
    - `NSObject` is a bad choice:
        - pointer is the hash and == is the isEqual
        - any subclasses of NSObject I create are also poor

```objc
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
#import <XCTest/XCTest.h>

@interface EqualityTests : XCTestCase

    } else {
        XCTFail(@"Fail!");
    }

    // isEqual works on NSString instances
    if ([a isEqual:b]) {
        NSLog(@"String objects are equal");

    NSArray *as = @[@"a", @"b"];

        NSLog(@"Array objects are equal");
