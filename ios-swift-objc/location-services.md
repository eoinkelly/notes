# Location services

Steps to setup a project

1. add 'location-services' and 'gps' (if you need the accuracy) to the
   UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities in Info.plist
2. link to the _Core Location_ framework

Reasons location services might not be available:

- Device in flight mode
- User denied access
- User disabled location services in settings

You can check their availability with

```objc
[CLLocationManager locationServicesEnabled] // returns YES if they are, otherwise prompts user
```

There are 2 types of location services available:

1. Standard
2. Significant change
    - 500 M or more

- Significatn change location service
    - will wake up the app after it has been "suspended" or "terminated"
        - when it is woken up you have to re-start location services and send
          your update within 10sec
    - if the user disabled "background app refresh" either globally for for your
      app then this wake-up will not happen
        - on phone `Settings > General > Background app refresh`

# Terminology

"suspended" "terminated"

# background locations

Tracking location in the background is a special case. The options are:

1. significant change location service
    - does not provide "high precision" location data
    - is the most battery friendly way to do location tracking
    - the system will wake the app whenever the users location changes
      "significantly"
    - if the app is terminated after starting this service the system will
      restart it to get the update
2. foreground only location services
    - uses standard Core Location service to get location data
    - stops delivering updates if the app is suspended
3. background location services
    - uses standard Core Location service to get location data
    - requires that the system monitor location via radio so is battery hungry
    - enabled by setting UIBackgroundModes to 'location' in Info.plist
    - does not prevent the system from suspending the app (unlike 'audio' which
      does prevent your app from entering the "suspended" state).
    - does tell the system that it should wake the app whenever there is a new
      location to deliver
        - if the user force quits you this will not happen
