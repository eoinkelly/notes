# Tests

Tests are compiled into a "bundle" (a plugin that is loaded at runtime by
another binary) and then loaded into the "host appliation".

```
// Running file on a compiled tests bundle
âžœ  Build  file Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/KatasTests.xctest/KatasTests
Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/KatasTests.xctest/KatasTests: Mach-O bundle i386
```

TODO: find out more about bundles, see info in `frameworks.md`

The testing framework reckons it can do unit and integration tests

Tests are within their own bundle so to access the app bundle you use

[NSBundle bundleForClass:???]

- Tests are grouped into classes, each with their own setup & teardown
    - They are similar to RSpec `describe` blocks
- You have good control over what tests run in the test navigator
    - can show only failing tests

QUESTION: Is there any way to stub/mock/spy in ObjC?

QUESTION: ObjC seems to compare objects based on value not identity ???

```objc
- (void)testXCTNotionOfEquality {
    // * NSObject objects are equal if they have their properties have the same values
    BlogPost *p1 = [[BlogPost alloc] init];
    p1.title = @"hello";
    BlogPost *p2 = [[BlogPost alloc] init];
    p2.title = @"hello";
    XCTAssertNotEqualObjects(p1, p2);

    NSArray *a1 = @[ @"hi", @"there" ];
    NSArray *a2 = @[ @"hi", @"there" ];
    XCTAssertEqualObjects(a1, a2);
}
```

# Helper things

All of these are available from cocoapods

OCHamcrest https://github.com/hamcrest/OCHamcrest _ a library of matchers and a
way to write new matchers _ available for many languages http://hamcrest.org/
(maybe origins in java)

- OCMock
    - very mature, 10 years old
- OCMockito https://github.com/jonreid/OCMockito
    - newer
    - more lightweight than OCMock
    - an ObjC version of Mockito (a java mocking framework)
