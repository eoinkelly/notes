# Pro Drupal 7 Development 3rd Edition

* Drupal is a sort of _application platform_
* Can run on MySQL, PG, SQLite
* Can use any webserver
    * Apache is most popular
* Drupal **needs** web server URL rewriter to do clean URLs e.g. `mod_rewrite` in Apache
* Drupal 7 rewrote its DB layer - the DB layer is based on _PHP data object_ (PDO)
    * this is what allows Drupal to support multiple databases
* Drupal has coding standards for PHP, JS, CSS Twig etc.
    * https://www.drupal.org/node/318
    * https://www.drupal.org/node/318#helpermod lists some tools for doing code review
        * tools are shipped as Drupal modules
        * they do have a "standard" config for [PHP Codesniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer)
* Drupal is architected as
    1. A library of common functions
    2. A set of "core" modules
    3. You can add modules from 3rd parties or make your own
* Modules
    * Are named `something.module`
* Drupal modules interface with drupal via callbacks/hooks
  * Drupal finds your module's callback handlers via a simple naming convention
    * If the `hook_user_login` hook fires then Drupal will look for a funciton in your module called `{module_name}_user_login`
* Themes
    * Templating options:
        * _PHP Template_ (the primary Drupal templating engine)
            * most popular for making themes
        * _Easy Template System (ETS)_
    * Themes can override parts of the page by implementing a function with the correct name
* Nodes
  * The base object type in Drupal
      * A bit like `Object` in Ruby, everything in Drupal _is a_ node.
    * Nodes have some base behaviours
      * be promoted to front page
      * be searched
      * be published or unpublished
  * The admin interface can mix & match things in various places and batch edit nodes because it just depends on their "nodeness"
* Fields
    * Nodes have fields
    * Fields is the base content type in Drupal
    * node content is defined as collections of fields
    * Modules can create new field types or combine existing fields to make new complex types
* Blocks
    * are things which can be put into locations in your template
    * templates have placeholders for blocks and then a module or admin can fill in the blocks
* Installation profile
    * A set of instructions to run **after** the base Drupal install has run to install the site i.e.
        * which modules to enable/disable
        * which contributed modules to download (I'm not 100% it will download new modules for you btw)
    * You can download new installation profiles and put them in `profiles/`
        * They give you a "distribution" of Drupal tuned for a specific use-case
    * Examples (which come as standard with Drupal 7)
      * `minimal`: a minimal Drupal installation
      * `testing`: installs just what is required for testing
      * `standard`: a standard Drupal installation
* File layout
    ```bash
    includes/ # libs of common functions
    modules/ # contains core modules (do not edit)
    misc/ # JS, icons, images from the stock Drupal installation
    profiles/ # installation profiles
    scripts/ # various helper scripts: cron stuff, running test suites. Not used in request cycle
    themes/ # contains the template engine and default themes (do not modify this dir)

    sites/ # contains all your modifications to Drupal

    sites/all/modules # you install modules here

    sites/default/default.settings.php
    # * your default configuration file, used by drupal installation process to create sites/www.mysite.com/settings.php

    sites/www.mysite.com/settings.php # my site settings

    sites/default/files
    # * stores uploaded files
    # * web server needs rw permissions on this
    # * drupal installer will try to create it if it can

    sites/default/private
    # * used to store "private" files that aren't served to users unless they are authenticated in some unspecified way
    # * unclear if this is created by default or you have to create it yourself

    sites/all/themes
    # * custom themes go here

    cron.php # used to execute periodic tasks (e.g. pruning DB tables)
    index.php # main entry point for serving requests
    install.php # entry point for Drupal installer
    update.php # updates the database schema after a Drupal version upgrade
    xmlrpc.php # receives XML-RPC requests, can be safely deleted if you don't need that feature
    robots.txt # default

    authorize.php
    # * an admin script for running "authorized file oeprations" e.g. download and install a new theme or module
    # * you don't run this directly, instead you invoke some part of the Admin UI which redirects you to this script to do certain steps
    ```
* General observations
    * All the PHP code in a Drupal app is checked into your repo - all the modules are "vendored" in there too

### Patches

* The `patches/` dir has a number of patch files (ala git)
* They seem to patch certain composer packages
* looks like they are manually applied via the `patch` command line tool
* Reasons for using them
    1. Fix errors running old Drupal on newer PHP versions
        * these changes are checked into git
    1. Fix bugs in composer packages
        * these changes are **not** checked into git
        * Composer can patch packages via the https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches plugin
            * just refernce your patch in `composer.json`

Serving a request

Consider a request for http://example.com/foo/bar

1. mod_rewrite rewrites http://example.com/foo/bar to http://example.com/index.php?q=foo/bar
    * the URL is assigned to the `q` query parameter
1. `index.php` executes
1. Drupal bootstraps itself on **every** request - there are ? bootstrap phases (defined in `bootstrap.inc`)
    1. Configuration: set global variables for use in bootstrap process
    2. Database: Initialize the database system and register autoload functions
    3. Variables: Load system variables and all enabled bootstrap modules
    4. Session: Initialize session handling
    5. Page header: Invoke `hook_boot()`, init the locking system and send default HTTP headers
    6. Language: Init all the defined language types
    7. Full: Final phase, Drupal is fully loaded now, this phase validates and fixes the input data

Example of  how requests are routed to modules:

    URL: http://example.com/q=node/3
    Maps to:
        Module: `node.module`
        Function: `function node_page_view()`

There are 2 categories of modules:

1. core - come with Drupal
2. contributed - community created

### Info files (Drupal 7.x only)

* .info files are used for module metadata
* they are a Drupal extension of PHP built-in INI files
* The .info file should have the same name as the .module file and reside in the same directory.
    * For example, if your module is named example.module then your .info file should be named example.info.
* This file is in standard .ini file format, which defines properties in key/value pairs separated by an equals sign (key = value).
* Can wrap values in quotes. Quoted values can contain newlines
* `;` comments out the line but must be first on the line
* Details: https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/creating-custom-modules/writing-module-info-files-drupal-7x
* Has a predefined list of keynames

NB: when you change an info file you have to clear the cache for drupal to notice

NB: Drupal 8 replaced .info files with .yml https://www.drupal.org/node/1935708

### Clearing the cache

* Option 1: Visit /admin/config/development/performance in your site admin and use the button
