# Phar files

* JAR archives for PHP basically
* lets you put a whole PHP app in a single file
* you can reference files within phar files from a php script
* All Phar archives contain three to four sections:
    1. a stub
    1. a manifest describing the contents
    1. the file contents
    1. [optional] a signature for verifying Phar integrity (phar file format only)
* use the `phar` tool to work with them

```
$ phar info mine.phar
$ phar list mine.phar
```

           -f  <file>   Specifies the phar file to work on.

           Optional arguments:

           -i  <regex>  Specifies a regular expression for input files.
           -x  <regex>  Regular expression for input files to exclude.


meta-del   Delete meta information of a PHAR entry or a PHAR package.
           If -k is given then the metadata is expected to be an array and the
           given index is being deleted.
           If something was deleted the return value is 0 otherwise it is 1.

           Required arguments:

           -f  <file>   Specifies the phar file to work on.

           Optional arguments:

           -e  <entry>  Name of entry to work on (must include PHAR internal
                        directory name if any).
           -k  <index>  Subscription index to work on.


meta-get   Get meta information of a PHAR entry or a PHAR package in serialized from. If
           no output file is specified for meta data then stdout is being used.
           You can also specify a particular index using -k. In that case the
           metadata is expected to be an array and the value of the given index
           is returned using echo rather than using serialize. If that index does
           not exist or no meta data is present then the return value is 1.

           Required arguments:

           -f  <file>   Specifies the phar file to work on.

           Optional arguments:

           -e  <entry>  Name of entry to work on (must include PHAR internal

           -k  <index>  Subscription index to work on.


meta-set   Set meta data of a PHAR entry or a PHAR package using serialized input. If no
           input file is specified for meta data then stdin is being used.You can
           also specify a particular index using -k. In that case the metadata is
           expected to be an array and the value of the given index is being set.
           If the metadata is not present or empty a new array will be created.
           If the metadata is present and a flat value then the return value is
           1. Also using -k the input is been taken directly rather then being
           serialized.

           Required arguments:

           -f  <file>   Specifies the phar file to work on.

           -k  <index>  Subscription index to work on.


pack       Pack files into a PHAR archive.
           When using -s <stub>, then the stub file is being excluded from the
           list of input files/dirs.To create an archive that contains PEAR class
           PHP_Archive then point -p argument to PHP/Archive.php.
