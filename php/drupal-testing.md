# Drupal 8+ testing

Drupal core 7.x has legacy systeem called 'SimpleTest' which is being removed

## Unit tests

- no DB
- Mocking: prophecy
    - chips with phpunit
- `UnitTestCase` is the core class

## Kernel tests

- you have a DB
- only specific modules installed
- only specific entity types installed
- only specified configuration and schemas installed
- descends from `KernelTestCase`

## Function Tests

- does a full "Testing" profile install
- this is what SimpleTest was (the only kind of test available in Drupal 7)
- can GET POST requests
- Installs all configurations and schemas
- installs module dependencies
- Inherits from `BrowserTestCase`

## Javascript Functional tests

- identical to functional tests but uses WebDriver (as of 8.5) to test JS
  interactions (it used to be Phantomjs)
- inherits from `JavascriptTestCase`

## Behat

- tests the actual site install (with all your admin changes)
- you point behat at your "test server" and run behat against it
    - have a process that clones prod data and sanitizes it
- config dependent scenarios
- behat is currently the best way do do a full end to end test of a drupal site
- https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2793445 would allow
  `BrowserTestCase` and `JavascriptTestCase` to be run against a real site which
  would mean you don't need behat
    - but it hasn't landed yet so only exists as a patch you can add

## Code quoality tips

- raise an exception if you encounter a problem
- use asserts for things that should not be possible (they usually don't run in
  PHP in prod mode)
