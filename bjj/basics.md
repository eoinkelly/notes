# Basic principles

To roll the oponent you need them to either be a cylinder or a sphere

# Base

Rickson Gracie talks about

1. Keep your "base"
    * knees slightly bent but not too bent
    * sit your weight down slightly
    * makes you stronger in all directions
    * core somewhat tensed but not too tense
1. Create a "connection" with the opponent
    * conneciton is not the same as grip
    * a good strong connection is a grip that connects your body strongly to the opponents
    * you can have a firm grip of an opponent but no proper connection

# Rear naked choke

* A blood and oxygen choke (aiming to block windpipe and neck arteries)
    * it is the pressure change in his head that causes him to go unconscious
* It is very important to control their fall if they go unconscious

Example on right side

1. Slide my right thumb around their neck until their **adams apple** is in my elbow
    * Keep my head close to their head to minimise chance of being headbutted
    * Being too low on the neck makes it less effective
1. Walk my right hand as high as possible up my left shoulder
1. Use my left arm as a clamp to keep my right hand on my left shoulder. Walk my left hand into the space behind their head
1. Bring my elbows together to make the space their neck lives in smaller
1. Posture up to put uncomfortable upwards pressure on their neck

# Choke from having their back

Start with me having opponents back and they get up to their hands and knees

1. I want to stay on their back so I hook my feet around their inside thighs
    * That helps keep me from being too high on their back (where they could shake me off)
1. Optionally let them struggle with my weight for a bit
1. Reach an arm under their armpit and grab the wrist and pull it back towards me - this causes them to fall on their face
1. From here establish a rear naked choke as above

# Escape side control to guard

* Start with opponent having you in side control

1. Use my forearms as a lever to shuffle my body upwards so opponent is over my hips and is touching my thighs
    * this makes the upcoming bridge effective
1. Bridge and rotate your hips so you are lying on your side facing opponent
1. Bring the shin nearest the ground up so it is across their hips
    * I _think_ you want to make sure your knee is outside their hips
1. Use that shin as a fixed point, rotate your hips so you are lying on your
   back facing them. While that is happening also wrap your legs around their
   torso to put them in my closed guard


# Pass opponents guard to get to side control

Start with being in your opponents guard

1. Place my hands strongly on the center line of their chest
    * prevents them from pulling me down
1. Posture up (sit up off my haunches to a kneeling position
    * keep my head looking upwards (looking down curves my spine and makes me natually learn forward
    * I want my weight to be independent of the opponent, I'm sitting back, holding my own weight
1. Put my right knee in their butt-crack
1. Step out with the other knee, taking care to keep it away from the region where their hands could grab it and prevent the pass
    * Aside: that is one way to defend the pass is to hook your hand around their stepped out heel, then when they try to pass you will rotate with them
1. Use left **hand** (not elbow to push their right knee forward and break their guard
1. Bring my other arm under their leg so my shoulder is under their hamstring
1. Drive forward to put their knee in their face
1. Using my weight on their leg, rotate my legs around to the right. As I rotate and their leg naturally wants to come down, let it and then take side control.


# What to do when you are mounted

If you get mounted

1. At first fight it and try to not the opponent to settle into the position. But if they do then:
1. Keep them as low as possible over your hips (try not to let them get a high mount)
1. Get to a position with your elbows tucked in against your body (elbows keeps their mount low) and hands protecting your neck
1. Do NOT push them with your hands
    * extending your arms gives them an opportunity to get an arm lock

# Prevent opponent from passing out of my guard into side control via a sweep

Start with opponent in my guard, him trying to pass.

This example is rolling to the ?

1. They are in my guard and they posture up i.e. their weight is off me
1. I grab his right wrist and clamp it against my chest with my left hand
1. I grab his right-side collar with my right hand (or if no gi, put my right hand around his head)
1. I turn my hips to the left 90 deg
    * one leg is on the ground beside his leg
    * the goal here is to tip him over my leg which is on the ground by pushing with my other shin on his other hip and pulling with my am
    * in this case I am trying to make his body into a "sphere"  shape to roll him
1. I follow him over as he falls and get into mount

# Escape from being mounted to their guard

Examples:

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK5-HLPZqPw

My strategy here is to preven them from posting with either their hand or foot on the side i'm going to roll them to


Start with them in mount

1. Opponent attacks in some way which lets me get one of their arms
    * Examples:
        * Opponent puts their forearm over my throat
1. I clamp down on their wrist with one hand and do something with the other hand to bring their elbow against my body e.g.
    * grab their tricep and pull down
    * grab their gi at the tricep and pull down
    * clamp my hand over their elbow and push it down
    * keeping their elbow on my body keeps their body close to mine (we want our torsos to be a single cylinder for easy rolling)
    * the goal here is to control their arm on the side I'm going to roll them to so they can't post it and so their body is positioned for easy rolling
1. I place my feet for a bridge and bring the foot on the side I'm going to roll to up to block their foot from posting out
1. I bridge and role, taking opponent with me, following him to ground and ending up in his guard
    * the Rickson Gracie method shown in the video above has a tweak to the roll
        1. bring your ear to your shoulder that your are not rolling towards
        1. then roll over your other shoulder, using your head and shoulder as the points you are rolling over
            * this makes the roll more at 45 deg rather than just sideways

# Mount to taking arm bar

1. Opponent does something to expose an arm
    * Example 1:
        1. You Lie on opponent, putting all your weight on their chest
        1. Opponent pushes your chest off them (a narrow benchpress type movement), and you let them
            * i.e. opponent has extended their arms away from their body - this leaves their arms vulnerable
1. Place my hands on his chest, one on eiter side of the arm I intend to attack
1. Pop up to a squat where both feet are on the unattacked side of opponent
    * Method 1:
        1. Placing weight on my hands, pop up from mount to a squat where foot on the side i'm not attacking is in its normal position but the foot on their side that I am attacking is up by their head (kind of "pop up to squat and 45 deg turn)
        1. Foot nearest their head steps over their head
    * Method 2:
        1. From kneeling, roll your weight back to a squat
        1. Putting weight on the foot on non-attacked side, step from their hip on attacked over their head (so both feet are on non-attacked side
1. Slide down their arm, aiming to sit as close to their shoulder as possible
1. Keep control of their arm as you go:
    * keep little finger against your upper chest - you are pulling their arm away from them as you sit (this makes the arm bar more effective)
    * keep your knees tight together
    * lean back (stretching the arm as you go) putting pressure on the elbow joint
    * thrust up with hips after you have leaned back as  far as possible to continue putting more pressure on the elbow joint


# Forced Figure four on far arm from side control.

Starting with me in side control on right side

1. Cup their shoulder with my right hand, keeping my arm between their elbow and their ribs
1. Press on their arm with my chest to move their arm to the position I want it (my chest being much stonger than me pushing them with my arm)
    * If i can't make it work with my chest I can
        1. walk my feet around 45 deg so my rib cage is pushing that arm away from their body, then grab it with my hand and walk back to side control and continue as before
1. Once their wrist is in the position I want it, grab it with my left hand to pin it in place
    * Bring his elbow and wrist as close to his body a possible
    * bring his elbow as low as possible - this helps position it for the submission
1. Grab my left wrist witg my right hand to pin my left hand in place
    * At this point my left hand is holding their wrist on the mat and my right hand is holding my wrist in place
1. Slide my right knee so it is resting **on** his hip
    * I am NOT posturing up or taking weight off my knees - I want to stay in good side control
    * this pins his hips down, making it harder for him to bridge and make himself some space to get free
1. Lift their elbow by hugging it towards me to apply the submission

If opponent pushes on my hip with their right arm as I am trying to rotate around I can grab that arm, swing my leg over their head and arm-bar that arm


# Opponent kneeling, me on my back with my feet on their hips, me holding both their wrists

A requirement for all these techniques is to make sure I ahve control of his arms first by grabbing both wrists and stop him attacking me with them

## Option 1 - trip them

The goal here is to push them over so they are on their back

1. I grab both his wrists
    * I want to take his hands out of the picture to stop him defending the things to come
1. They stand up
1. They step a foot forward within range of me grabbing it
1. I grab their heel with my hand, keeping my foot in their hip on the same side I grabbed
    * this prevents them from posting with that foot
1. I hook their hamstring with my other foot
    * this prevents them stepping backw ith that foot
1. I then push with the foot that is still in their hip to knock them backwards
1. As soon as their butt hits the mat I get up  on my knees to start attacking their guard (or half guard if I can get there quickly enough)


## Option 2 - roll them over my head

The goal here is to end up in mount

1. I grab both his wrists
    * I want to take his hands out of the picture to stop him defending the things to come
1. They stand up
1. I continue their momentum of standing up to take their weight on my legs (i'm suspending them at this point)
1. I tuck my legs which throws them over my head and I roll with them (keeping my feet in his hips) to end up in mount
    * it's not really a "throw", more of a "we both roll over and I end up in mount"

# Option 3 (sweep them into mount)

Start with opponent kneeling, me on my back, having already grabbed both his wrists

1. I drop one foot of their hips and lay it flat on the ground
1. I reposition the other foot so my shin is pushing above their hip
1. I sweep across with the shin pushing their torso (it can go as high as under their armpit, tipping them over my foot on the ground
1. I follow them around into mount

# Option 4 - control with legs until a trip opporunity presents itself

The goal here is to not get really tired trying to keep my feet in his hips for a long period of tim

We start with me having gotten control of his wrists and having both feet in his hips as opponent is standing and I'm on my back.

I can move my feet between the following positions

1. Bicep
1. His hip
1. Hook behind his hamstring

It is important to only move one foot at a time, if I move both at the same time I will lose control of him
It is important for the "connection" of the hook behind the hamstrings to be strong enough to keep him off balance - try to push his knees out

As I change how my legs are controlling him, I can sometimes let go of his wrists when I have a foot controlling the bicep of that arm
When I free up a hand like that I can reach for his heel and do the trip option above
