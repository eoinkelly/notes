## Videos from Rama

- add white to a pure color = tint
- add black to a pure color = shade
- add grey to a pure color = tone (tint and shade equally at the same time)

A pastel = a color with a lot of white added (a very light tint)

# The Photoshop color picker

- has pure colors on the vertical bar. The box lets you tint, shade, tone
- Top right corner = pure color
- move down = add black = shade = decrease brightness %
- move across = add white = tint = decrease saturation %
- horizontally towards center point = tone
- a pure pastel will be on the top edge of the box (whte added but not black)
