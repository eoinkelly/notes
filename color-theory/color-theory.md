## Videos from Rama

* add white to a pure color = tint
* add black to a pure color = shade
* add grey to a pure color = tone (tint and shade equally at the same time)

A pastel = a color with a lot of white added (a very light tint)

# The Photoshop color picker

* has pure colors on the vertical bar. The box lets you tint, shade, tone
* Top right corner = pure color
* move down = add black = shade = decrease brightness %
* move across = add white = tint = decrease saturation %
* horizontally towards center point = tone
* a pure pastel will be on the top edge of the box (whte added but not black)
