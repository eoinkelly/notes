# Arithmetic

* a branch of mathematics
* has 4 basic operations
    1. Addition
    2. Subtraction
    3. Multiplication
    4. Division


Addition

* can be used to count concrete items .e.g. apples
* can also be applied to the abstraction of numbers
* can also be applied to other mathematical objects e.g.
    * vectors
    * matrices
    * subspaces
    * subgroups

is defined set of properties which:

1. it is commutative (order does not matter)
2. it is associative (grouping order does not matter)
3. Adding 0 does not change the result (0 is the identity element)

4. Within the Integers, repeated addition of 1 is the same as counting (maybe this is only in the Integers?)

Humans first explored these properties in the counting numbers
addition in the counting numbers is just one (maybe the first) example of addition
the idea of the abstract addition operation is not the same as it's concrete implementation in the counting numbers


Q: is addition an "operation you can impose on a group of objects" or an "intrinsic property that emerges from the group"?
Q: does multiplication flow from addition? Can you have multiplication if you don't have addition?
