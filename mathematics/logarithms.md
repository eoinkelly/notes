# Logarithms

* scientists were struggling with multipling large sets of numbers
* wanted to convert the multiplications into simpler addition problems
* Napier created the technique based on ratios of two values
    * ratios of arithmetic values is logos arithmos in latin became logarithms
    * -- method was very complex
    * created tables of pre-computed values so scientists could use the table and skip the computation
* 200 yrs later we realised that logarithms were "backwards exponents"
* the original motivation for logaithms is now replaced by computers

log_b(x) = a

maybe a better name for the function is "power"
power_b(x) = a

b^a = x

the base must be > 1 (base == 1 is a problem)
