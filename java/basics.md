# Java language

General

- types have uppercase names

## static

- makes the variable/function shared between **all** instances of the class
- makes the member belong to the type, not the instances of the objects.

## final

- A final variable can only be initialized once
- A final method cannot be overridden or hidden by subclasses
    - prevents subclasses from doing anything dodgy with the method
    - the difference between `final` and a constant is
        - a constant's value is known at compile time
        - a final variable value may not be known until runtime
- if the member points at an object then the contents of the object can be
  mutated but the reference cannot be changed.

## package

- a named group of related classes
- default class visibililty is to be "package private" i.e. visible only to
  other classes in the same package
- IDEs want to organise classes by package (creating a new subdir for each `.`)
    - TODO: why?
- If your src file does not declare a package it is considered to be in the
  "default package"
    - TODO find out more

## access control

- https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html

- classes contain members (a term which includes both methods and data)
-

- there are two levels of access control

1. top level
    - applied to classes themselves
    - there are two options for access control here
        1. package private (default, no modifier keyword)
        2. public (selected by prefixing class name with `public` keyword)
            - makes the class visible to **all** other classes in the app
2. member level
    - there are ? options for access control here
        1. package private (default, no modifier keyword)
            - this member can be accessed from any class in its package
            - this member is **not** available to subclasses of this class
              unless they are in the same package
                - QUESTION: what is the use case for subclasses in a different
                  package?
            - NOTE: there is no keyword for "package private" - it is indicated
              only by the lack of an access keyword
        2. public (selected by prefixing class name with `public` keyword)
            - this member can be accessed by any class in any package in the
              system
        3. private
            - this member can only be accessed from within its own class
        4. protected
            - this member can only be accessed by
                1. any class in its package
                2. any subclass of its class in another package
            - => protected is "package private + subclasses of this class in any
              package"

## nested classes

- https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/nested.html
- nested class is a member of its enclosing class
    - as such the normal access control keywords apply to it
- two types of nested class
    1. non-static nested class aka "inner class"
        - has access to **all** members of the enclosing class even if they are
          declared `private`!
        - is associated with an instance of the outer class
            - => it cannot declare any static variables itself
        - variables with the same name in the inner class as the outer class
          will shadow the variable in the outer name.
            - you can access the outer class variable if you need to via
              `OuterThing.this.varName`
        - Syntax for instantiating these is ugly:
          `OuterClass.InnerClass innerObject = outerObject.new InnerClass()`
            - note that we call `new` on an instance of `OuterClass` not
              `OuterClass`
    2. static nested classes
        - they don't have any special access to the other members of the
          enclosing class
        - is behaviouraly exactly the same as any other top level class - it has
          just been nested to imply some link to the outer class
        - Syntax for instantiating these is straightforward:
          `OuterClass.InnerClass x = new OuterClass.InnerClass()`

## interfaces

- signify a "role" that an object can play
- a class can implement multiple interfaces i.e. play multiple roles
- can only contain
    1. constants
    2. method signatures aka "abstract methods"
    3. default methods
        - can have method body
        - have the `default` modifier as prefix
        - when an interface extends an interface that has a default method you
          can
            - redeclare it (makes the original default method abstract)
            - redefine it (completely overrides the default method)
        - can be redeclared (overridden) by classes that implement the interface
        - can be redefined by
    4. static methods
        - can have method body
    5. nested types
- interfaces cannot have fields (data members)!
- interfaces cannot be instantiated
- they can be implemented by classes
- they can be extended by other interfaces
- an interface can be used as a data type (anywhere you could use a class)
- you can make changes to an interface over time by
    1. using interface extnsion to make a new or specialised version of the
       interface while not breaking existing client code
    1. use default methods to add new methods to an interface and not break
       existing code

## super

- super is a keyword
- it lets you access methods from a superclass
- `super.foo()` will search through the inheritance hierarchy (starting with the
  superclass of the current class) and try to find the method.
- In constructors `super(<args>)` will call the appropraite constructor from the
  superclass

## Object

- Similar to Ruby, `Object` is the parent of the java class heirarchy

## null

- can be returned from a method no matter waht the return type is declared as

## finalizers

- TL;DR - almost never use them.
- there may be a long delay before they are actually called by the VM
