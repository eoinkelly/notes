    ```
    Spreadsheet? MobX
      Persistent relational data? Relay
      Normalizing data from multiple endpoints? Redux
      Everything else: component state
    ```

## Options for state mangement

1. root component does it all
1. container components do it
1. flux does it
1. flux-saga does it
1. mobx does it

I'm not considering relay here because moving to graphql is not an option right
now

## react-rails contstraints

Using react-rails with the following assumptions

- there will likely be multiple "react roots" on the page (the page is still
  mostly server side
- go easy on the fancy es6 stuff as a lot of the team don't do JS fulltime

## A sensible growth plan seems to be

For each "react root" on the page:

1. Start with a root component that manages all state
1. refactor into container components (which can manage state) when you see
   opportunites
1. refactor into flux if state management becomes hairy using container
   components

Component state is still used even with flux/mobx/whatever

flux & friends are for when multiple react components need to work with the same
set of data (and maybe persist it to server(s) or at least different endpoints)

What if multiple react roots need to share state?

- options:
    - move directly to flux, inject the flux store into all react roots
    - ???
