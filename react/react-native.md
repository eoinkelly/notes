# React native

- JS on background thread
- does the "change diffing" to a native view layer (native view elements exposed
  as React components e.g. `UIButton -> <Button>`
- rendering happens "off the main thread"
    - QUESTION: how ???
- "learn once write anywhere"
- unclear whether same code will run on both platforms
    - it seems to just be a new way to make native apps
    - instead of ObjC/swift use JS
- Already in use by FB for some of their apps
- No DOM, no webview, just JS as a native app development language

- QUESTION: Debugging ???
- QUESTION: Interop with existing native APIs that are not views ???

Reasons for react native

- Touch handling is much better on native
    - they don't go into this much in the videos
- Native components exist and are, in their opinion, always better than
  alternatives
    - instead of outputting DOM elements it outputs UIView classes
    - the views are set on the main thread, the diff algorithm runs on a
      different thread
    - they run jscore
    - it is possible to run the JS that powers the app remotely via websockets!
- layout is very different across ios, android, web
    - from gpu pov layout is just setting top, left, width, height
    - they think ios native layout is mostly maths, even the linera constraint
      solver has problems e.g. can't do line breaks
    - they think flexbox is the best way to do layout
    - there is NO webview
    - they have created their own parser that will parse flexbox and create a
      similar tree of nodes that have w,h,top,left
    - they re-implement a subset of CSS - they focused on the subset they could
      make fast, and were most useful
