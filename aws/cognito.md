# AWS Cognito

How authentication happens:

1. Client sends `InitiateAuth`
2. Cognito replies with challenge
3. Client sends `RespondToAuthChallenge`
4. Go back to step 2 if there are more challenges
5. Cognito sends tokens

- We can use AWS Lambdas to customise the flow
    - Cognito can run lambdas to receive the `RespondToAuthChallenge`

Terminology

- SRP
    - Is a protocol
    - Has an RFC https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2945
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol
        > one party (the "client" or "user") demonstrates to another party (the
        > "server") that they know the password, without sending the password
        > itself, nor any other information from which the password can be
        > broken. The password never leaves the client and is unknown to the
        > server.

There are 5 authentication flows

1. Client-side Auth flow
    - Designed for iOS, Android, Javascript in browser apps
    - Flow
        1. App calls `InitiateAuth` with users' username and "SRP details"
            - The app generates the SRP details by using the Amazon Cognito SRP
              support in the Android, iOS, and JavaScript SDKs.
        1. Cognito sends back a challenge
        1. The app calls `RespondToAuthChallenge` with its response
        1. If another challenge is required, respond with a "session" and go
           back 2 steps (the session lets Cognito link the challenges together
        1. If response is ok then Cognito issues tokens.
1. Server-side Auth flow
    - Designed for server apps
    - Flow
        1. App calls `AdminInitiateAuth` with Rsers' username and User's "SRP
           details" and AWS admin credentials
            - The app generates the SRP details by using the Amazon Cognito SRP
              support in the Android, iOS, and JavaScript SDKs.
        1. Cognito sends back "Authentication parameters"
        1. The app calls `AdminRespondToAuthChallenge` with its response (must
           also send AWS admin credentials)
        1. If another challenge is required, respond with a "session" and go
           back 2 steps (the session lets Cognito link the challenges together
        1. If response is ok then Cognito issues tokens.
1. Custom Auth flow
    - use this flow if you need to customise with Lambdas

1. Admin auth flow
1. User migration auth flow
    - Allows you to migrate users from another system using a "User migration
      lambda"

> After successfully authenticating a user, Amazon Cognito issues JSON web
> tokens (JWT) that you can use to secure and authorize access to your own APIs,
> or exchange for AWS credentials.
