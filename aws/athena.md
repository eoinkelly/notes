# Athena

> Amazon Athena uses Presto with ANSI SQL support and works with a variety of
> standard data formats, including CSV, JSON, ORC, Avro, and Parque

Supported formats:

- CSV
- JSON
- ORC
- Avro
- Parque

large joins, window functions, and arrays

> use AWS Glue to automatically crawl data sources to discover data and populate
> your Data Catalog with new and modified table and partition definitions.

Presto

- https://github.com/prestodb/presto
- Runs on Hadoop
- Written in Java
- Originally by Facebook
- Open source distributed SQL query engine

> You can also connect to Athena from a wide variety of BI tools using Athena's
> JDBC driver.

> Athena enables you to run SQL queries across data stored in relational,
> non-relational, object, and custom data sources

> store results in Amazon S3 for subsequent use.

> Athena executes federated queries using Athena Data Source Connectors that run
> on AWS Lambda. AWS has open source data source connectors for Amazon DynamoDB,
> Apache HBase, Amazon Document DB, Amazon Redshift, AWS CloudWatch, AWS
> CloudWatch Metrics, and JDBC-compliant relational databases such MySQL, and
> PostgreSQL. You can use these connectors to run federated SQL queries in
> Athena. Additionally, using the Athena Query Federation SDK, you can build
> connectors to any data source.

# Glue

- Fully managed ETL service
- Runs serverless
- Jobs can be run on a schedule or based on events
- Can pull data from S3, RDS, MongoDB, basically most things
- Generates Python/Scala to do the actual transformation of your data from
  sources to destinations
- Can import from AWS or JDBC-compatible source
- Glue discovers your data and stores the associated metadata (e.g. table
  definition and schema) in the AWS Glue Data Catalog.
- Once cataloged, your data is immediately searchable, queryable, and available
  for ETL.
