# RFC 1918

http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1918.html

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has reserved the following three blocks of the IP address space for private internets:

    10.0.0.0        -   10.255.255.255  (10/8 prefix)       (the 24-bit block)
    172.16.0.0      -   172.31.255.255  (172.16/12 prefix)  (the 20-bit block)
    192.168.0.0     -   192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix) (the 16-bit block)

We will refer to the first block as "24-bit block", the second as "20-bit block", and to the third as "16-bit" block.

Note that (in pre-CIDR notation):

* the first block is nothing but a single class A network number
* the second block is a set of 16 contiguous class B network numbers
    * 16 -> 31 inclusive is 16 class B (16 bit, 65535 host) networks
* the third block is a set of 256 contiguous class C network numbers.

Aside: CIDR = Classless Inter Domain Routing. The "Classless" bit refers to the fact that the older way of refering to networks grouped them into classes but this way does not.

To conform to RFC 1918, routers are expected to filter out packets with addresses in these ranges.
