# Amazon Linux

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/amazon-linux-ami-basics.html

- is CentOS based
- uses yum for packages
- will install security updates which are rated **critical** or **important** on
  launch
    - there may be other security updates available
- pre-installs the AWS CLI tools
- the default user is `ec2-user`
- There are normal and minimal versions of the AMI available
- Updates
    - Updates are provided via a pre-configured yum repository hosted in each
      Amazon EC2 region.
    - Security updates are automatically applied on the initial boot of the AMI.
    - Upon login, the Message of the Day (/etc/motd) indicates whether or not
      any additional updates are available.
- The Amazon Linux AMI is built and maintained as a rolling release.
    - They encourage users to think of the Amazon Linux AMI as a single river of
      packages, of which the AMI images themselves are just snapshots in time

Useful files

```
# identifies the image
/etc/image-id

# specify currently installed release
/etc/system-release

# machine readable version of system-release
/etc/system-release

# OS release details
/etc/os-release
```

Only "critical" and "important" security upgrades are installed on launch. This
is controlled by

```
#cloud-config
repo_upgrade: security
```

TODO this doesn't seem to work properly - what am i missing?

Logs live in `/var/log/ecs`

```bash
# Add -y to default to 'yes' answers to interactive prompts
yum update -y

# To list all updates that are security relevant, and get a return code on whether there are security updates use:
yum --security check-update

# To upgrade packages that have security errata (upgrades to the latest available package) use:
yum --security update

# To upgrade packages that have security errata (upgrades to the last security errata package) use:
yum --security update-minimal

> and are accessed using yum update tools. Hosting repositories in each region
> enables us to deploy updates quickly and without any data transfer charges.

> Amazon Linux 2 and the Amazon Linux AMI are updated regularly with security

> customizations for your instances, you can simply launch new instances using
> the current AMI. If you need to preserve data or customizations for your
> instances, you can maintain those instances through the Amazon Linux package
