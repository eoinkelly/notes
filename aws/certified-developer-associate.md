History

- AWS (SQS only) announced first in 2004
- 2012 Re-invent is the main AWS conference
- first certifications offered in 2013

Goals

- Aim to get 70% to ensure a pass (pass mark is moveable day by day)
- Pass mark moves on a bell curve
- Only need to know a few of the AWS services in depth for the exam

```
AWS fundamentals            10%
Designing and developming   40%
Deployment and security     30%
Debugging                   20%
```

### Layer 0: Global infrastructure

- https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/

This "global infrastructure" underlies all other AWS services

Important:

- A region is a _geographical area_
- An availability zone (AZ) is a "logical" data center (it is often one physical
  data center but can be more)
    - each AZ is isolated (separate power and network) so in theory if one AZ
      goes down then the region is still OK
    - each AZ can be only meters apart provided it has separate power, network
    - each AZ in a region is connected with a direct fibre link
        - capacity 25Tbps, latency 1-2ms
- Each region ALWAYS has 2 or more availability zones
- Edge locations are CDN endpoints for cloudfront
    - there are many more edge locations than AZs (currently over 66 edge
      locations)
    - edge locations are where users access AWS content

- As of Dec 2016:
    - 14 regions,
    - 38 availability zones
    - 66+ edge locations
- 2017: adding 4 regsions, add 11 AZs
- The number of regions and AZs does NOT come up in the exam so it is only _nice
  to know_

Relevant for NZ _ Closes region is *Asia Pacific Sydney* _ they have 3 data
centers (AZs) in Sydney _ they have 2 availability zones (data centers) in
Singapore _ there are edge locations in Sydney and melbourne \* nothing in NZ

### Layer 1: networking

- sits on top of the global infrastructure

- Virtual private cloud (VPC) [VERY IMPORTANT IN EXAM]
    - Virtual data center
    - can have multiple VPCs per region
    - can have multiple VPCs in your account
    - can get them to peer with each other
    - a "data center" which exists in your account
    - each VPC has a logcially isolated set of resources
    - each VPC in your account can be in different regions
- Direct connect
    - connect to the AWS without using using a public internet connection
    - uses dark fibre
    - connects your own data center directly into AWS
- Route 53 [IMPORTANT IN EXAM]
    - is their DNS service
    - called route 53 because DNS is on port 53
- Cloudfront
    - CDN service
    - Integrates with other products e.g. S3
    - edge location is a place with caches your files
    - is a fairly big part of the exam

- Snowball
    - part of import/export service
    - lets you send your own hard disks to AWS
    - they will load the data from the disks onto storage
    - so you don't have to send your data over the internet
    - snowball is the enterprise version of this
        - a suitcase looking device
        - you pay for it on a daily basis
        - is a "petabyte scale data transport solution

    - ActiveDirectory
- supports multifactor authentication
- allows you to provide temporary access for users/devices and services when
  necessary
    - how ???
- allows you to setup your own password rotation policy
- supports PCI-DSS compliance

Terminology

- user
    - an individual user
- group
    - a collection of users
- role
    - a role can be _applied_ to both users and AWS services
    - allows resources in AWS to access other resources in AWS without having to
      setup and store usernames and passwords
    - when a user is authenticated by some other entity (i.e. they are not an
      IAM user) they assume a role to get access to AWS resources
    - Exam q:
        - You can assign a one (and only one!) role to an EC2 instance during
          provision
        - Once an EC2 instance has been provisioned you cannot switch roles for
          it! GOTCHA
            - you can change the permissions on the role while the EC2 instance
              is running but you cannot change the role
- policy
    - a document that defines one or more permissions
        - attach them to users, groups, roles
    - Each policy has a "policy document" which is a blob of JSON
        ```
        // the AdministratorAccess policy
        {
        "Version": "2012-10-17", // this is always the same
        "Statement": [ // can have multiple statemetns
            {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "*",
            "Resource": "*"
            }
        ]
        }
        ```
    - Attach policies to groups and then put users in the gorups
        - don't attach policies to users usually

Random exam questions

- Oregon is the default region when you setup a new AWS account
- IAM is not region specific - it is global (there is a q on exam about this)
- By default when you create a new user they have no permissions!

Root account is the email address you used when you setup the AWS account _ best
practice _ always use MFA for root account \* don't login as that account to do
day to day admin stuff

### Federation

- With identity federation, external identities (federated users) are granted
  secure access to resources in your AWS account without having to create IAM
  users.
- These external identities can come from
    1. your corporate identity provider (such as Microsoft Active Directory or
       from the AWS Directory Service)
    2. from a web identity provider, such as Amazon Cognito, Login with Amazon,
       Facebook, Google or any OpenID Connect (OIDC) compatible provider.
- IAM supports identity providers who are compatible with either Security
  Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 or OpenID Connect (OIDC)

#### Active Directory Federation

http://blogs.aws.amazon.com/security/post/Tx71TWXXJ3UI14/Enabling-Federation-to-AWS-using-Windows-Active-Directory-ADFS-and-SAML-2-0

- You can authenticate yourself to AWS with your Active Directory credentials
- You do it with a _Security Assertion Markup Language_ (SAML) token
- On the AD side it uses _Active Directory Federation Services_ (ADFS)
- Steps
    1. you authenticate yourself to the AD server on your corporate network and
       it gives you a SAML token
    2. your browser gives that SAML token to the "AWS sign-in endpoint for SAML"
       aka https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml
        - The AWS SAML services uses the `AssumeRoleWithSAML` API to request
          temporary security credentials (API name is on exam)
        - it then constructs a sign-in URL for the management console
        - it then gives that URL to the browser
    3. You have successfully authenticated yourself to AWS and can see the
       dashboard
- You always authenticate against Active Directory first and then use the token
  you authenticate to AWS

Aside: you can create windows servers on AWS what kind of virtualization does
that use? can windows VMs and linux VMs be on the same hardware?

#### Web identity federation

https://web-identity-federation-playground.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

- for the exam: you need to know that you _can_ use facebook, google, any OIDC
  provider to autenticate yourself to aws
    - don't use the phrase "login" because you don't have an IAM user so maybe
      it is not accurate

Random exam q: ARN = Amazon resource name

This is an OpenID flow

1. Login in with your identity provider and get an access token from them
2. Get _temporary_ security credentials
    - Make a `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` request (hint: name of API call is in
      the exam)
    - this will let you assume a _role_ (note: not a user) that was created for
      you
        - => roles can be humans sometimes!
3. You can use that role to access things

# EC2

Aside: the three defined local networks in RFC 1918:

```
10.0.0.0    - 10.255.255.255        10.0.0.0/8
192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255       192.168.0.0/16
172.16.0.0  - 172.31.255.255        172.16.0.0/12
```

4 types of EC2 pricing

1. On demand
    - You pay a fixed rate by the hour with no commitment
    - use for workloads which are long-term, spiky unpredictable usage, cannot
      tolerate interruption
1. Reserve
    - you commit to 1yr or 3yr contract for a certain set of resources and
      Amazon gives you a decent discount
    - can pay up-front for more discount
    - useful if you know what capacity you will need
    - applications with steady state or predicatable usage
    - can supplerment reserved instances with on-demand instances for peak load
      times
1. Spot
    - you set a "bid price" for a particular region and AZ
    - you bid on the "spot price". when the spot price drops below your bid,
      your instance will start. when the spot price rises back up over your bid
      your instance will terminate
    - handy if you can be flexible about when you start/stop compute
    - handy for apps which are only feasible at very low compute prices
1. dedicated hosts
    - physical EC2 host for your use, you can pay by the hour
    - handy if you have software licences which are
    - useful if regulatory requirements prohibit multi-tenancy
    - you can reserve dedicated hosts or have them on-demand

EXAM QUESTION: If an instance is terminated by **amazon** because the spot-price
went above your bid-price you will NOT be charged for that partial hour of
usage. If **you** terminate the instance then you WILL BE CHARGED

EC2 instance types

- Each instance type has a single letter family name and a version e.g. `D1`,
  `D2` etc.
- D = density, dense storage (file servers, data warehousing, hadoop)
- R = memory (RAM)
- C = compute optimized
- M = main, general purpose
- G = graphics intensive
- I = iops, high speed storage
- T = general purpose, low cost
- F = FPGA (hardware acceleration, ML)
- P = Graphic/general purpose GPU (ML, bitcoin mining)
- X = memory optimized (extreme memory optimized)

Use "Dr Mc GiftPX" as a shitty memnonic to remember the families

EXAM QUESTION: you will be given a scenario and asked to choose the best
instance type for it (the options will include some types which don't exist)

M and T are the families we care about most

You start with nothing but one security group which is the default security
group in the default VPC

An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a _template_ that provides _ operating system _
application server \* applications

- Sources of AMIs
    - Amazon provides approx 22 images
    - you can buy others from the marketplace
        - these tend to be provided by software vendors and have their software
          pre-installed
        - sometimes 3rd parties have pre-installed OSS apps e.g. gitlab
    - download community made ones
    - make your own

Free tier = you can run certain micro instances for 1 year for free

- Amazon have their own linux AMI which includes many common server packages
    - it is based on red hat (it uses yum at any rate)
- the data in an instance store is not permenant - it persists only for the
  lifetime of the instance

```
# example instance specs
t2.micro (Variable ECUs, 1 vCPUs, 2.5 GHz, Intel Xeon Family, 1 GiB memory, EBS only)
```

Choosing region and data center for your instance

- choose region before you create the instance
- choose AZ (data center) by choosing the subnet the instance is in during
  instance setup
    - AWS creates a default VPC for you in each region with one subnet in each
      of the AZs of that region
- Shutdown behaviour
    - stop = just stop the instance
    - terminate = stop & delete the instance
- "User data" field
    - a textarea where you can paste a shell script that will be run as root
      when the instance is launched
        - it is only run automatically when the instance is _launched_ - it does
          NOT run automatically when the instance starts/stops
    - max 16kB length
    - you can submit user data via the API but you must base64 encode it first
    - to modify user data for a running instance
        1. stop the instance
        2. modify the user data section via the AWS web console
        3. start the instance - the new userdata will be available
        4. `curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data | sh`
    - you can get user data back from a running instance by either
        - `curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data` from the instance
        - Use the web console
- Security group
    - basically configured the firewall that your instance will sit behind
- EC2 instance has two network interfaces
    1. private: lets you access other AWS resources in the subnet
        - this is the only one visible when ssh'd into the box
        - hostname is built from this IP address
    2. public: lets you ssh in
        - not visible when you `ifconfig -a` within the instance

To SSH to an EC2 instance:

```
# 1. get IP address from the instance description in AWS console
# 1. Locate the .pem file which is the private key you created/used when creating the instance
# 1. chmod 0600 my-key.pem file (ssh will refuse to use an identity file that is world writable)
chmod 0600 my-key.pem

# 1. ssh into the box
#     username:
#         * you will be prompted to retry if you get it wrong so no biggie
#         * ec2-user is the default username for Amazon AMI images
#         * ubuntu is the default username for Ubuntu images
#     -l sets login name (username)
#     -i sets identity file (private key)
ssh 52.63.84.255 -l ubuntu -i my-key.pem
```

```
#/usr/bin/env bash
# example script to use when creating ubuntu instances
# all commands run as root
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
apt-get install tree
```

AMI attributes _ root device type _ EBS _ of 38k community AMIs, 30k are this _
Instance store _ of 38k community AMIs, 8k are this _ virtualization types _ HVM
_ TODO: find out more _ paravirtual _ TODO: find out more

EBS

- allows you to create storage volumes and attach them to EC2 instances
- once attached you can create a filesystem on the volume or do anything else
  you would do with a block device
- EBS volumes live in one AZ
- EBS volumes are automatically replicated across physical devices within an AZ
- different EBS volume types

1. General purpose SSD (GP2)
    - balance price and perf
    - 3 IOPS per GB with up to 10k IOPS and the ability to burst up to 3k IOPS
      for extended periods of time for volumes under 1GB
2. Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1)
    - use for IO intensive apps e.g. databases
    - use if you need more than 10k IOPS
    - can go up to 20k IOPS per volume
3. Throughput optimized HDD (ST1)
    - big data, log processing, data warehousing
    - useful for large amounts of data which will be written in sequence e.g. a
      log
    - GOTCHA: cannot be a boot volume
4. Cold HDD (SC1)
    - A file server you don't need to access very often
    - GOTCHA: cannot be a boot volume
    - basically this is an unbootable version of "Magnetic standard" (they use
      the same disks)
5. Magnetic (standard)
    - can be a boot drive
    - lowest storage cost of all **bootable** EBS volume types
    - useful if data is accessed infrequently or cost is a limiting factor

EXAM TIPS

- know different EC2 pricing models
- know that you pay for the partial hour only if you (not amazon) terminate the
  instance
- know your EBS types and when to use them
- Remember "Dr Mc GIFT PX" (the scottish doctor who gives away photos)

EXAM QUESTION: YOu cannot mount an EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances! If you
need something like this use EFS

When creating an EC2 instance _ default monitoring is every 5 mins _ "Cloudwatch
Detailed monitoring" is every 1 min

EXAM QUESTION: What happens to the EBS volume attached to an EC2 instance when
you terminate the instance? A: it depends on whether the box was ticked to
delete the volume at termination when you were setting up storage for the EC2
instance

EXAM QUESTION: You do need to know the default things which cloudwatch will
monitor on your instance

EXAM QUESTION: By default you cannot encrypt root device volume of an EC2
instance \* you can get around it by 1. create volume unencrypted 1. option: 1.
take an AMI snapshot of it and encrypt that snapshot 1. use that snapshot to
create a new EC2 instance 1. option: 1. encrypt the volume with other software
e.g. bitlocker on windows

Security groups

- a security group is a set of virtual firewall rules - it is NOT "a firewall" -
  it is "a set of rules for a firewall"
- any change you apply to a security group applies **immediately** - this is an
  EXAM QUESTION
- security groups are **stateful** - if you have an inbound HTTP rule and no
  outbound rules then outbound HTTP is still allowed!!!
    - any inbound requests you allow will be allowed to answer
- in security groups, everything is blocked by default and you create rules to
  allow things
    - an implication of this is that if an instance is part of multiple security
      groups, the rules from those groups are strictly additive - there is no
      such thing as a "DENY" rule in security groups
- an instance can be behind multiple security groups
- all inbound traffic is blocked by default
- all outbound traffice is allowed by default
- security-group has a many-to-many with ec2-instances
- you cannot block specific IP addresses using security groups - you **can**
  allow traffic from only one IP (or IP range) but you cannot block

EBS volume can only be attached to EC2 instances in the **same** AZ!

You can attach volumes at

    /dev/sdf
    /dev/sdg
    .
    .
    .
    /dev/sdp

> Note: Newer Linux kernels may rename your devices to /dev/xvdf through
> /dev/xvdp internally, even when the device name entered here (and shown in the
> details) is /dev/sdf through /dev/sdp.

Snapshots

- are stored on S3
- are point in time copies of a volume
- are incremental
    - they only store the delta between current snapshot and previous one

Aside: Opsworks

> From devops slack: OpsWorks is chef-solo with triggers around Auto Scaling
> Groups lifecycle + JSON hints for AWS instance metadata as far as I know.

Roles again

Creating a role:

1. choose name for role
2. choose "role type"
    - role type is the kind of resourse that will use this role to access other
      resources
        - the role type controls where trusted entities come from i.e. things
          trusted to play the role
        - example
            - Amazon directory services
                - `Trusted entities: The identity provider(s) ds.amazonaws.com`
            - Amazon EC2
                - `Trusted entities: The identity provider(s) ec2.amazonaws.com`

- Exam Q: you cannot assign new roles to an existing EC2 instance - roles can
  only be assigned at creation

Each EC2 instance can only have one role which must be assigned at creation _
that role can have policies attached/detached _ you can delete the role itself
and then the instance will have no role attached and one cannot be attached

CLI commands for the developer associate exam

1. aws ec2 describe-instances (describe your instances)
1. aws ec2 describe-images (list all available instances)
1. aws ec2 run-instances (creates an instance, 'start-instances' starts an
   existing instance but does not create one)
1. aws ec2 terminate-instances

Aside: `~/.aws/credentials` overides any credentials in `~/.aws/config`

- Accessing S3 (or any AWS resource) from an EC2 instance
    - you can setup access to S3 from an EC2 instance via the command line tools
      the same way you would on your laptop
        - -- is a security hole as if EC2 instance is compromised your keys must
          be changed
        - roles is safer - role at least forces attacker to get to your s3 from
          the EC2 instance not from any computer they choose

Aside: starting an instance via the API

```
# we could use the user data to configure each server to play a different role
# (that's probably a bad approach, just an example)
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-2bb65342 --count 3 --instance-type t2.micro --user-data "rails|postgres|redis"
```

#### EC2 instance metadata REST API

While ssh'd into an EC2 instance you can use `curl` to hit a HTTP endpoint that
returns metadata about the instance you are currently on

```
# list available metadata
$ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
ami-id
ami-launch-index
ami-manifest-path
block-device-mapping/
hostname
iam/
instance-action
instance-id
instance-type
local-hostname
local-ipv4
mac
metrics/
network/
placement/
profile
public-hostname
public-ipv4
public-keys/
reservation-id
security-groups

curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/hostname # see hostname
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4 # see public IPv4 IP address NB

curl http://169.254.169.254/ # to start searching

curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document # see instance details

# /latest/meta-data contains lots of config info about the machine ('/' suffix
# indicates its a namespace with more values underneath)
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
ami-id
ami-launch-index
ami-manifest-path
block-device-mapping/
hostname
instance-action
instance-id
instance-type
local-hostname
local-ipv4
mac
metrics/
network/
placement/
profile
public-hostname
public-ipv4
public-keys/
reservation-id
security-groups
```

Note: `ifconfig` will show you only the private interface of your instance - you
must use the metadata to get the public interface IP

You can use the REST API with curl in your shell scripts that automate your
instances The REST API knows things like the order your instances were launched
in a group

Random things you need to know for the exam

- multiple SSL certificates can be terminated on a single elastic load balance
  (ELB)
- ELBs are not free
    - you are charged by the hour and per GB
- services which are free (but the resources they spin up are not free)
    - Cloud formation
        - Gotcha: the resources you spin up via cloud formation are paid
    - Elastic Beanstalk
        - Gotcha: the resources you spin up via elastic beanstalk are paid
    - Autoscaling
        - Gotcha: the resources you spin up via elastic beanstalk are paid
- ELBs can use the following ports
    - 25 SMTP
    - 80 HTTP
    - 443 HTTPS
    - 1024-65535 Custom ports
- HTTP Codes
    - 200 = request succeeded
    - 3xx = redirection
    - 4xx = client error
        - 404 URL not found
    - 5xx = server error
- You need to know the curl URL to use to get the public IP address of an EC2
  instance
- know the available SDKs
    - Android, iOS, Javascript (browser)
    - Java
    - .Net
    - node.js
    - Ruby
    - PHP
    - Python
- default region for some SDKs is `us-east-1` (e.g. Java)
    - others force you to set a region before you can use them e.g. Node.js

# Lambda

- came out Reinvent 2015
- ways of using
    1. an event driven" compute source
        - event can be changes to an S3 bucket, a dynamoDB table etc.
    2. a compute service in response to HTTP requests using "Amazon API Gateway"
       OR APi calls made using the AWS SDKs
- languages available
    1. nodejs
    1. java
    1. python 2.7
    1. c#
- pricing
    - first million requests are free, $0.20 per million requests after
    - you are also charged by "duration" = the time your code spends executing
      rounded up to the nearest 100mS
    - you are also charged based on the amount of memory you allocate

# S3

- is object based - you can store files but not install software (exam q)
    - you cannot install operating system or database on it
- data is stored across multiple devices and "facilities"
- files can be 1 byte to 5TB in size (exam q)
- files stored in buckets (exam q)
- storage is unlimited in theory (exam q)
    - in reality Amazon monitor how much storage is being used and add capacity
      if needed
- S3 has a _universal namespace_ so bucket names are universally unique (exam q)
    - if you register bucket "foo" it does not matter which region you used -
      others cannot use that name to register a bucket in any other region
- bucket names cannot contain uppercase characters
- your bucket url contains the region in its unique URL
- each bucket has a unique url `https://{region}.amazonaws.com/{bucket-name}`

S3 consistency model (exam q)

- READ after WRITE consistency for PUTS of new objects
    - you can read new objects immediately after uploading them
- eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES
    - can take some time for changes to propagate after making changes or
      deleting a file
    - i.e. there might be a delay before your changes/deletion can be read
        - in practice this delay is usually ???
- S3 is a simple key-value store (think mongodb etc.)
    - each "object" in S3 contains 6 things
    1. key = name of object
    2. value = data (sequence of bytes
    3. version id
        - used for versioning
    4. metadata
        - data about the object
            - date created
            - date modified
    5. Access control lists
    6. Subresources
- Amazon garuantee 99.99% uptime (up to 52.6 mins downtime per year)
- Amazon garuantees 99.999999999% (11 9's) durabilty for S3 information
    - if you put 100 billion files on S3 you could lose 1 file and still be
      within the durability margin
- Tiered storage avaialble (exam q)
    - S3 storage tier
        - data stored redundantly across multiple facilities
        - can sustain the loss of two AZs
        - has "11 9's" durability
    - S3 infrequently accessed S3-IA
        - you have infrequent reads (e.g. monthly, 6 months, yearly) but they
          need to retrieved within a few seconds
        - is very new
        - has "11 9's" durability
        - cheaper than S3 but you pay a retrieval fee
    - RRS Reduced redunancy storage
        - provides 99.99% uptime and 99.99% durability over a given year
            - so if you upload 1000 files you could lose one
        - handy for data you can easily regenerate e.g. thumbnails of images
        - can only tolerate the loss of one AZ (as opposed to two AZ for normal
          S3)
    - Glacier
        - archival only
        - takes 3-5 hours to restore an object from glacier
- Lifecycle management
    - rules which move your objects between different storage tiers
- Versioning
- Encryption
- Secure your data with ACL and bucket policies
- S3 charges. Your S3 is charged on:
    1. storage
    2. requests
    3. data transfer pricing

- If you change the permissions on an individual file they will be reset the
  next time you overwrite that file
- You can change storage class for individual files
    - => not all files in the same bucket have to have the same storage class
      (Standard, Sandara-IA, Reduced Redundancy)

GOTCHA: S3 web hosting does not support HTTPS - you can setup cloudfront to do
it if you need

Important Exam Q: Be able to tell the difference between a bucket URL and a
website hosted link

```
# Bucket URL:
https://s3-{REGION_NAME}-amazonaws.com/{BUCKET_NAME}/{FILE_PATH}
# * note https only

# Website URL:
http://{BUCKET_NAME}.s3-website-{REGION_NAME}.amazonaws.com/{FILE_PATH}
# * note http not https
# * note bucket name is the subdomain, region is part of the domain name
```

Storage order/hot spots

- S3 stores files in alphabetical order (lexographical order)
- If you have a lot of files that have similar names e.g. log files with a
  timesamp prefix you will create a performance "hot spot"
    - they recommend salting your filenames to keep them more random and this
      will "spread the load across S3"

Exam Question: Maximum uploads

The largest file you can upload with PUT is 5GB - if you want to upload more
than that you need to use multi-part upload

CORS

- CORS is not enabled by default on S3 buckets

default cors proxy configuration

```
<CORSConfiguration>
    <CORSRule>
        <AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
        <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
        <MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>
        <AllowedHeader>Authorization</AllowedHeader>
    </CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```

CORS config I used for an ember app

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
    <CORSRule>
        <AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
        <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
        <AllowedMethod>POST</AllowedMethod>
        <MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>
        <AllowedHeader>accept</AllowedHeader>
        <AllowedHeader>content-type</AllowedHeader>
        <AllowedHeader>origin</AllowedHeader>
    </CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```

Each CORS rule must contain

1. the set of origins/domains and HTTP methods you want to allow for those
   origins.
2. Optionally, you can also specify the headers users can set in requests or
   access in responses and the duration the preflight responses should be
   cached.

Versioning

- Stores all versions of an object including deletes
- Integrates with lifecycle
- Can force users to use 2FA to delete objects
- Once versioning is enabled it can NEVER be disabled - it can only be
  suspended. If you need to turn it off you need to delete the bucket and
  re-make it
- Versioning does nothing smart about storing files that are mostly the same -
  it simply stores another full copy of the file
- Cross region replication requires versioning to be enabled on both the source
  and target buckets
    - only replicates objects added to the bucket after it was turned on - it
      will not update existing files

Lifecycle management

- can be used with versioning or can be independnt of it
    - you can move older versions to other storage tiers
- transitioning to the S3-IA storage tier has requirements
    - files must be on S3 for 30+ days before being moved to S3-IA
    - S3-IA storage is set at object level not bucket level
    - minimum filesize is 128Kb - smaller objects are charged for 128 Kb storage
    - you can only move things from S3-IA to Glacier 30+ days after they have
      been in S3-IA
        - so there is 60+ days from first upload to hitting glacier
- You can go directly from normal S3 to glacier
- You cannot move things to (Reduced Redundancy Storage) RRS via lifecycle
  policies

Minimum storage durations

- AWS still wants to get paid even if your storage needs are very spiky so they
  use minimum storage durations
- S3-IA
    - Data that is deleted from S3-IA within 30 days will be charged for a full
      30 days
- Glacier
    - Data that is deleted from S3-IA within 90 days will be charged for a full
      90 days
        > If an object archived in Amazon Glacier is deleted or overwritten
        > within three months of being archived then there will be an early
        > deletion fee. This fee is prorated. If you delete 1GB of data 1 month
        > after uploading it, you will be charged an early deletion fee for 2
        > months of Amazon Glacier storage. If you delete 1 GB after 2 months,
        > you will be charged for 1 month of Amazon Glacier storage.

Logging

- S3 can log all access to a bucket

Security and encryption

- by default all buckets are private
- options for setting access controls
    1. bucket policies
        - permissions applied to the entire bucket - EXAM Q
    1. access control lists
        - can apply to individual objects - EXAM Q
- buckets can generate access logs to
    1. another bucket
    1. another aws account

Two types of encryption in S3

1. In transit
    - SSL/TLS
2. Data at rest
    1. Server side encryption a. SSE-S3 S3 managed keys _ AES-256 _ Amazon
       manage all the keys for you b. SSE-KMS (Server side encryption with Key
       management service) _ provides an audit trail _ allows you to use an
       envelope key c. SSE-C Server side encryption with customer provided key
    2. Client side encryption
        - you encrypt the data on client and upload it to S3

Storage gateway appliances (is popular topic on exam)

- connects on-premises software appliance and the AWS cloud
    - you put a virtual appliance (not a real box) in your data center which
      acts as the gateway
    - the appliance is avaiable for download as a VMware or Microsoft HyperV
    - can use the public internet to connect OR use "direct connect"
    - Storage gateway use S3 for all storage
- Types of storage gateway
    1. File gateway (NFS)
        - flat files
        - stored on S3
        - files are accessed through an NFS mount point
        - ownership, permissions, timestamps are stored in S3 metadata
        - can use all the S3 features on the files e.g. versioning, lifecycle
          management, cross-region replication
        - QUESTION: could I make a home dropbox clone with this?
    2. Volume gateways (iSCSI)
        - presents your apps with disk volumens using iSCSI block protocol - a
          "virtual hard disk"
            - your local machines think they are writing to another local
              machine via iSCSI but the storage gateway appliance is actually
              sending it to S3
        - types of volume gateway
            1. Stored volumes
                - all data is stored locally, backups are made to AWS
            2. Cached volumes
                - only most recent vesion of data is on premises, all other
                  versions are in cloud
    3. Tape gateway (VTL)
        - replacement for physical tape based backup
        - the "virtual tapes" are stored on S3
        - used for backup
        - uses popular backup appliations like Net Backup, Backup Exec, Veam
          etc.

EXAM: know the three kinds of gateway and when to use them

Snowball & Import/export

- Import/export disk (precursor to snowball)
    - lets you send amazon hard disks to import to AWS
    - can import _to_ one of three places
        1. Import to EBS
        2. Import to S3
        3. Import to Glacier
    - can only export _from_ one place
        1. export from S3
- Import/export snowball
    - Can only import/export to S3
    - 3 types
        1. Snowball
            - 80TB snowballs available in all regions, physically secure, 256
              bit encryption
            - 50TB snowballs availabe in US
        2. Snowball edge
            - 100TB storage,
            - has compute capability too - can run lambda functions
        3. Snowmobile
            - is a shipping container on a truck
            - is an exabyte scale transfer service
            - for massive data

Cross region replication

- builds on versioning of buckets
- you cannot replicate across buckets in the same region
- uses roles to allow the buckets to talk to each other
- you must enable versioning on source and target butcket to do corss region
  replication
- if you setup replication from a source to destination bucket only NEW changes
  will be seen - existing data in the source bucket will not be automatically
  replicated
    - but once a file is has a change then all versions of it from the
      source-bucket will be replicated
- you can only replicate to one bucket from a bucket
- when you "undelete" a file (by removing the delete-marker version) that will
  not be replicated across

# Cloudfront

- CDN lets you keep your content geographically close to your users
- Terminology
    - Edge location
        - the location where content will be cached (exam q)
        - there are 50+ edge locations currently
        - is NOT the same as a region or an availability zone
    - Origin
        - the origin of all files that the CDN will distribute - can be
            - S3 Bucket
            - EC2 instance
            - Elastic Load Balance with EC2 instances behind it
            - Route 53
                - TODO find out more -does this mean you could use cloudfront
                  for stuff not on aws?
    - Distribution
        - A "CDN" which contains a collection of edge locations
- Steps
    - User hits URL for one of your assets that sends it to the edge location
    - file is not on the edge loation so the edge location will pull it from the
      origin and cache it
    - next user in that region will get it directly from that edge location
- Distributions can be used to deliver
    - static content
    - dynamic content
    - streaming traffic
    - interactive content (what is this?)
- works well with other AWS services (route53, ELB, EC2 instances, S3)
- works well it non AWS origin server
- Types of distribution
    1. Web distribution
        - for web content
    2. RTMP distribution
        - for streaming flash media
        - RTMP is an adobe flash protocol
- nearest edge location to NZ seems to be Sydney
- Edge locations are not just read-only! users can upload data through them too!
- Objects are cached for the life of the TTL (Time to Live)
- You can clear cached objects manually but you will be charged for it

Creating a distribution

- origins can be
    1. S3 bucket root
    2. a folder within an S3 bucket
- users can upload data via cloudfront
    - user uploads data to cloudfront (via HTTP POST PUT PATCH DELETE)
    - cloudfront stores the upload and then uploads it to your origin server
- TTL values are always in seconds
    - default TTL is 86400 seconds (1 day)
        - => how long cloudfront will go before updating data from origin
- AWS WAF Web ACL
    - WAF = Web application firewall
    - you can use a firewall to secure your content
        - TODO: find out more
- distributions can take 5-10 mins to be created
- Exam Question: you can have multiple origins in a distribution
    - => you can have a single cloudfront distribution that is a front from
      multiple S3 buckets
- you can use the "path pattern" regex to route requests to different origins
  within your distribution based on the URL e.g. all pdf files come from a
  particular bucket
- you can geo-restrict your content based on country
    - uses a whitelist or a blacklist
    - how does that work?
- "invalidations"
    - you can create an invalidation to remove files from the cache without
      waiting for a TTL to expire
    - IMPORTANT: you get some free validations each month but you pay for each
      invalidation you create after that
    - versioning objects via a filename fingerprint is a better way to go in
      general
        - the logs show accesses to old and new files
- S3 Transfer acceleration
    - Uses cloudfront edge location to accelerate uploads
    - Upload goes to the cloudfront edge location and then from there to your S3
      bucket
        - you get a separate URL to upload to your bucket via S3 transfer
          acceleration
            - `{BUCKET_NAME}.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com`
    - it does cost more money than normal uploads
        - there is a speed comparison page

# Databases services

- Two types of database processing
    - OLTP Online Transaction Processing
    - hits the DB lightly
- OLAP Online Analytics Processing
    - analyse a large volume of data
    - often a copy of the production DB
        - uses a totally differnt architecture and storage (e.g. columnuar) that
          the OLTP copy

1. RDS
    - Relation/SQL database
    - OLTP type database
    - Supports 6 databases (exam q)
        1. Postgres
        2. MySQL
        3. Oracle
        4. MariaDB
        5. Aurora
        6. MS SQL Server
    - not a huge amount about RDS in the exam
2. DynamoDB
    - Managed NoSQL service
    - Document oriented database
    - the most important topic on the exam!
3. Elasticache
    - in-memory cache service
    - supports
        1. memcached
        2. redis
4. Redshift
    - data warehouse
    - competitors
        - Cognos
        - Jaspersoft
        - SQL Server Reporting Services
        - Oracle Hyperion
        - SAP NetWeaver
    - used to run long-running queries on very large data sets
5. managed database migration service
    - moves views, triggers etc. too!!!

## DynamoDB

    Hint: DynamoDB is the most important topic on the exam

- supports document and key-value stores
- "single digit millisecond latency
- is a fully managed database
    - you can't ssh into the VM it runs on
- stored on SSD
- stored across 3 "geographically distinct" data centers
    - writes are written frist to one location and the replicated to the other
      two
- there are two types of reads
    1. eventual consistent reads (the default)
        - consistency across all copies of data is usually reached within a
          second
        - faster read perf than strongly consistent reads
    2. strongly consistent reads
        - a strongly consistent read returns a result that reflects all the
          previous writes that received a successful response
        - slower read perf than eventually consistent reads
- database structure
    - tables
        - contain items (akin to rows in SQL table)
            - contain attributes (akin to column values on a SQL table)
- pricing
    - charged by
        1. throughput
        2. storage
            - first 25GB per month is free
            - storage is $0.25/GB/month after that

Keys

1. Single attribut primary key
    - Partition key (also called Hash Key) composed of one attribute
        - DynamoDB uses the partition key as the input to a hash function that
          returns the "partition" (the physical location in which the data is
          stored)
        - Partition key values MUST be unique in a table
2. Composite attribute primary key
    - Made up of "Partition key" (used to be called "Hash key") and "Sort key"
      (used to be called "Range key") composed of two attributes
        - DynamoDB uses the partition key as the input to a hash function that
          returns the "partition" (the physical location in which the data is
          stored)
        - two items can have the same partition key value but if they do they
          must have different sort keys
        - all items with the same partition id will be stored together in the
          order sorted by the sort key value

Indexes

Local secondary index _ The index has the same partition key, different sort key
_ Can ONLY be created when creating a table - it cannot be removed or modified
later _ Can only have up to 5 LSIs on each table Global secondary index _ Can be
created at table creation or added later _ The index has a different partition
key and a different sort key _ Can only have up to 5 GSIs on each table

Streams

Used to capture any modification to the table

- On item create
    - the stream captures an image of the entire item including its attributes
- On item update
    - it captures before AND after images of the item
- On item delete
    - captures an image of the item before delete

- streams store data for a maximum of 24hrs
- can configure a trigger that tirggers a lambda function which can do whatever
  with it

Query operation

- finds items in the table using only the primary key attribute values
    - you must provide a partition attribute name and a distinct value to search
      for
- can optionally provide a sort key attribute name and value and use comparison
  operator to refine the search
- by default, query returns ALL the data attributes for items with the specified
  primary keys
- can use the _ProjectionExpression_ parameter so that the Query only returns
  the attributes you provide
- query results are always sorted by the sort key
    - sort order is numeric if sort key is a number
    - sort order is ASCII character code
    - default sort order is asending
    - can provide `ScanIndexForward` paramter to `false` to get descending order
        - note that despite the name, this parameter is only used on queries
- by Default is eventually consistent

Scan operation

- examines every item in the table
- returns all the data attributes for every item
- can use `ProjectionExpression` to choose a subset of attributes
- avoid using it on large table with a filter that removes many attributes
- scans can be very expensive because they can use up all your provisioned
  throughput in one go if the table is large

Table design tips

- for quick response times design tables so you can use Query, Get, BatchGetItem
  APIs insteand of scan

Calculting provisioned throughput (an exam topic)

- DynamoDB measures read and write capacity and usage in "units"

Things you need to know before you calculate

1. How large is each item (aka "row")in the table in KB?
2. How many items per second will you need to read?

- Units of read provisioned throughput
    - All item reads are rounded up in increments of 4KB e.g. 1KB item => 4KB,
      5KB item => 8 KB
    - Eventually consistent reads (default) consist of 2 reads per second
    - Strongly consistent reads are 1 read per second
    - a "unit" is a 4KB item read every 500 mS for eventually consistent reads
    - a "unit" is a 4KB item read every 1 S for strongly consistent reads
- Units of write provisioned throughput
    - all writes are 1KB
    - all writes consist of 1 write per second
    - a write "unit" is a single 1KB write each second

The read throughput formula

```
(read_size_rounded_to_nearest_4KB / 4KB) * num_of_items = read_throughput_in_units

Then divide by 2 if eventually consistent
```

Remember: an "item" is a "row" in the table

Write throughput formula

```
num_of_items * item_size_in_KB = write_throughput_in_units
```

If you exceed your read or write provisioned thorughput capacity for

1. a table
2. a global secondary index

you will get a HTTP 400

```
HTTP 400 ProvisionedThroughputExceededException
```

Web identity providers with DynamoDB

- you can authenticate a user using any provider that provides OpenID connect
  e.g. Amazon, Facebook, Google

1. User authenticates with the identity provider e.g. Facebook
1. User is given a token by their identity provider
1. Your code calls the `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` API passing
    - the identity provider token
    - the ARN for the IAM role that should be assumed
1. AWS STS (security token service) issues you with temporary security
   credentials
    - response contains
        1. (access key ID, secret access key, session token)
        2. expiration (time limit)
            - access is valid from 15mins to 1hr (defaults to 1hr)
        3. AssumeRoleID
        4. SubjectFromWebIdentityToken

Conditional writes

write new value to the DB if the old value is what I expect it to be

- if two processes try to write at the same time then one will fail because the
  value will not have the expected "old value"
- conditional writes are idempotent!
    - it doesn't matter how many times you send the write req, DynamoDB will
      only update it once

Atomic counters

- supports atomic counters
    - you use the `UpdateItem` API request to increment/decrement a value
      without interfering with other writes
    - these are "increment the value no matter what its current value is"
    - it's an update you want to do no matter what the current value is
    - atomic counters updates are NOT idempotent
- all write requests are applied in the order they are received

Batch operations

- can read multiple items in one request with `BatchGetItem` request
    - note the API name is singular (this comes up in exam)
- a single batch get can read up to 1MB of data and include up to 100 items
- a single batch get can read items from multiple tables

# SQS

- was the first AWS service launched
- a web service that provides a message queue that can store messages
- allows for distributed applications where some service(s) create messages and
  others consume/process them
- a queue is a temporory repository for messages awaiting processing
- queues are "fail safe" ???
- messages can be up to 256KB (this is an exam question)
- queue acts a a buffer between producer and consumer
- allows producer and consumer to be only intermittantly connected to the
  network
- allows producer to create messages more quickly than the consumer can process
  them
- sqs ensures delivery of the message at least once
- supports multiple readers and writers working on the same queue
- SQS does NOT garuantee first-in first-out delivery of messages
    - if you need to enforce order you must include some sequencing info in the
      message and have your consumer re-order messages as it receives them
- SQS queues never push messages - it is always pulled by the consumer e..g your
  EC2 instance must poll for messages

1. producer service sends a message to the queue
1. consumer service pulls the messsage from the queue
1. the "visibility timeout clock" starts once the message has been pulled by a
   consumer

1. consumer must finish its work and delete the message from the queue within
   the visibility timeout for the message to be considered "delivered"

- SQS can do autoscaling based on queue length
- you should design your system so that messages are idempotent i.e. it won't
  matter if they are processed more than once

- pricing
    - is charged in "requests" not in "messages"
    - each request can have up to 10 messages or 256KB data
    - first 1 million SQS requests each month are free
    - $0.50 per 1 million SQS request per month after that

- each 64KB "chunk" of payload is billed as 1 request e.g. a single API call
  with a 256KB payload is billed as 4 requests

exam tips

- SQS messages can be delivered multiple times and in any order
- you can make priorities by having multiple queues that your app pulls from
- SQS default visibility timeout is 30 sec by default (max is 12hrs)
- while processing a message (as a consumer) you can give yourself more time by
  sending the `ChangeMessageVisibility` API call and SQS will restart the timer
  with the new value
- Short polling returns immediately even if the queue is empty
- Long polling will return immediately if there are messages but will wait up to
  its timeout for a message to turn up if the queue is empty
    - Maximum long poll timeout is 20 sec
    - Long polling lets you save money on request

- Fanning out
    1. Create an SNS topic
    1. create and subscribe multiple SQS queues to the topic
    1. then when a message is sent to the SNS topic it will be passed on to each
       subscribed SQS queue

# SNS Simple Notification Service

- allows you to deliver messages from the cloud to "subscribers" and other
  applications
- instantaneous push based messages
    - this is a key difference between SNS and SQS - SNS pushes messages, SQS is
      pull only
- the data format of SNS is JSON
- is a pub-sub service
- pay as you go pricing
- will push messages to the following endpoint types
    1. Apple devices
    2. Android devices
    3. Amazon fire devices
    4. Baidu devices in china
    5. SQS (you can use SNS to inject messages into SQS)
    6. Text messages
    7. Email
    8. Any HTTP endpoint
- protocols (exam Q)
    1. Email
    2. Email-JSON
    3. Application
    4. Amazon SQS
    5. HTTP
    6. HTTPS
- messages can be customised for each protocol (exam Q)
- All messages are stored redundantly across many zones
- topics
    - allow you to group multiple recipients
    - a message sent to a topic is delivered to all subscribers to the topic
    - a topic can deliver to multiple endpoint types e.g. you can put all your
      iOS and Android users in the same topic

- pricing
    - $0.50 per 1 million Amazon SNS requests
    - $0.06 per 100k deliveries over HTTP
    - $0.75 per 100 deliveries over SMS (NOTE: 100, not 100k here!)
    - $2.00 per 100k deliveries over Email

# SWF Simple Workflow Service

- lets you coordinate work across different application components
- Amazon use SWF to fulfil orders from Amazon.com
- task
    - a task is the invocation of a processing step
    - a task can be performed by
        1. executable code
        1. web service calls
        1. humans
        1. scripts
- work is split into "workers" and "deciders"
- worker
    - a program that interacts with SWF to get tasks, processes the task and
      returns a result
    - can run on AWS cloud or on machines behind firewalls
- decider
    - a program that controls the coordination of tasks i.e. their ordering,
      concurrency, sheduling according to the application logic
    - can run on AWS cloud or on machines behind firewalls
- SWF brokers the interactions between workers and deciders
    - since SWF keeps track of applicaiton state durably the workers and
      deciders don't have to know about the application state so they can run
      independently and scale more easily
- SWF ensures a task is assigned only once and never duplicated
    - this is a key difference between SQS and SWF (also an exam Q)
- Domain
    - scopes your workflow, activity types and the workflow execution
    - isolates a set of types, task-lists and executions from others in the same
      account
    - can register a domain via the console or via the `RegisterDomain` API
- maximum workflow is 1 year and is measured in seconds (exam Q)
- SWF vs SQS
    - SWF is task oriented, SQS is message oriented
    - SWF assigns a task only once, SQS may deliver message multiple times
    - SWF keeps track of all the tasks and events in an application, SQS you
      have to implement your own appliation tracking logic
- exam tips
    - if the question involves humans you need SWF not SQS
    - if it might take longer than 12hrs to cmplete you need SWF not SQS

# Cloud formation

- lets you script creating infrastructure aka create "virtual data centers"
- using cloudformation is free but you do pay for the resources that it creates
  (exam Q)
- CF templates are JSON documents (exam q)
- CF templates
    - JSON format
    - can include function calls e.g. `value: { "fn::GetAtt":
      ["BackupLoadBalancer", "DNSName"] }
- you can define "outputs" in the script which let you expose data to the user
  e.g. the URL of an S3 bucket, the DNS name of a load balancer etc.
    - the "Fn::GetAtt" function is used to read attributes of the services you
      are setting up with the script for display in outputs (exam Q)
- by default it will rollback (delete all provisioned resources) if there is an
  error in your script

# Elastic Beanstalk

- command line tools
    - `aws elasticbeanstalk`
        - the general AWS-CLI tool has some commands for EB
    - `eb help`
        - there is a specific elastic beanstalk CLI tool
          (`brew install aws-elasticbeanstalk`)
- very similar to Heroku
- you pick a "platform" aka application type and
    1. upload a zip file of your code
    2. upload your code to S3
- platforms (exam Q)
    - Node
    - Go
    - Ruby
    - Python
    - PHP
    - Tomcat
    - IIS
    - Java
    - Docker
    - Docker with multiple containers
    - Docker + Go
    - Docker + Glassfish (Oracle OSS J2EE appliation server)
    - Docker + Python
- you don't pay for EB but you do pay for the resources it creates (exam Q)

# Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

- most important thing in the exam
- need to be able to build a VPC from memory
- by default you get a VPC based on region when you log in

- VPC is a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud
- VPC can span availability zones
- VPC CANNOT span regions
- you can
    - create your own subnets
    - launch instances into a particular subnet
    - configure route tables between subnets
    - create internet gateways and attach them to subnets
    - choose your own IP ranges
    - create subnet network access control lists (ACLs)
    - create "instance security groups"
- can create public facing subnets for web servers
- can create appliaction servers and DB servers in private subnets
- can create a hardware VPN connection between your VPC and your existing
  corporate datacenter
    - allows you to extend your data center with your VPC
    - an amazon "Virtual private gateway" is the thing you setup in AWS to talk
      to your existing datacenter - it interfaces your data center to your VPC
    - this is called "hybrid cloud"

- default VPC
    - user friendly
    - allows you to immediately deploy instances
    - all subnets have an internet gateway attached
    - all subnets are public subnets
    - each EC2 instance has a public AND private IP address by default
    - WARNING: if you delete the default VPC the only way to get it back is to
      contact AWS
        - you can just change region
    - I seem to have a different default VPC configured in each AWS region
- VPC peering
    - can connect VPCs to each other via a direct network route using private IP
      addresses
    - instances behave as if they are on the same private network
    - You can peer VPCs with other AWS accounts
        - TODO: dig into what this means (this is not part of exam)
    - You can peer VPCs with other VPCs in the same account
    - peering is always done in a star configuraiton (with 4 points)
        - one central VPC peers with others
        - consider 5 VPCs peered in a star:
            ```
                   C
                   |
            B <--> A <--> E
                   C
                   |
                   D
            ```
            where A is peered with B and also C. You cannot do transititve
            peering so if you want B and C to peer you have to set it up
            separately

    - NB: you cannot do transative peering!!! (this is examp Q)

- By default you can have up to 5 VPCs in each region (exam Q)
    - I assume you can contact support for more ???

Aside: CIDR = classless inter domain routing

- Creating a VPC
    - options
        - name - add a name tag to the VPC
        - CIDR block - the IP range to assign to this VPC e.g. 10.0.0.0/16,
          192.168.0.0/16
            - mask sizes must be between /16 (65536 hosts) and /28 (8 hosts)
            - maximum VPC network size is /16 on AWS
        - Tenancy
            - Dedicated
                - lets you specify that instances in this VPC should always use
                  single tenant dedicated hardware no matter what their launch
                  options are configured as
                - WARNING: a lot more expensive!
            - Default
                - Your VM instances use whatevery tenancy you choose when
                  launching them
    - creating a new VPC also creates
        1. new route table called "main"
            - this route table seems to only allow local traffic between
              instances in its CIDR block
        2. a network ACL
        3. a security group for the VPC
        - it does not create any subnets so we can't deploy anything into it yet

    - Aside: you can create a "flow log" which will log IP traffic to cloudwatch
      from your various VPCs network interfaces

- subnets
    - subnets area ALWAYS in a single availability zone (exam Q)
    - subnets can only be associated with one route table at a time
    - when you create a subnet you can choose which AZ in the region you want it
      to be in
        - but even if you don't, AWS will choose one for you
- You can only have ONE internet gateway per VPC (important exam Q)
- When you create an internet gateway it is not attached by default

1. Create the VPC
    - creates a "main" route table for you
    - creates a Network ACL for you
    - creates a security group for you
1. Create some subnets
1. Add an internet gateway to the VPC
1. Create a new route table which allows access out to the Internet
    - Don't add that route to your main route table because you don't want all
      subnets to default to having outside access
1. If subnet is public, change the "auto assign public IP" setting
1. If you forget to assign a public IP address you can do it alter by adding an
   "Elastic IP address" to the instance

How to allow instances on private subnets to pull in updates from the Intenet?

1. option: nat instance (old way)
    - create a new EC2 instance which amazon have configured to do NAT for you
    - put it in the public subnet
    - the private instances have access to it so can use it to bounce traffic
      out to the internet
    - you must disable the "source/destination check" for the instance because
      the NAT needs to route traffic which isn't to/from itself
    - you can get redundancy by putting your nat instance in an autoscaling
      group
    - if you are bottlenecking you can increase instance size
2. option: nat gateway (new way)
    - deploy it into the public subnet
    - you odn't have to manage the instance e.g. no security patches etc.
    - you don't have to worry about redundency - nat gateways do it for you
    - they scale u to 10Gbps
    - once you create a nat gateway you still have to change the route table for
      your private instances to route traffic to it

A "route table" is a collection of routing rules is associated with **subnet**
not instances A subnet has exactly one route table route tables have _
destination (the source IP addresses of instances _ target (where the packets
should go)

Tip: put a "bastion host" or "jump box" in your public subnet so you can access
your private instances via SSH

bastion hosts are used to securely admin private instances - they are often
hardened

IMPORTANT = a subnet cannot span across AZs \* security groups, route tables,
network ACLs can span multiple AZs

IMPORTANT = you can only have ONE internet gateway for each VPC \* they may ask
question implying you should add another Ingernet Gateway to VPC for perf or
security

To make a subnet be publically accessible

1. create a new route table and add a route that will allow all traffic from
   attached subnets to a chosen IGW
    - target: the internet gateway of your choice
    - source: 0.0.0.0/0
2. Associate the subnet with the route table

A "security group" can stretch across different AZs but a subnet cannot (exam Q)
Security groups _ are stateful - if you allow HTTP in then HTTP is also allowed
out _ are just a virtual firewall

EC2 instances source/destination check (this is important exam Q)

- by defaults EC2 instances have a "source/destination check" enabled
- this checks that the instance is either the source or destination of IP
  packets that flow through it i.e. it prevents it from being a NAT
- You need to disable this check via _Instance settings -> Networking_ if you
  are setting up a NAT instance
- comes up in exam giving you a scenario where your nat should work but doesnt
  buecause of source/destination check

He called the instance with the public IP that we ssh'd into to then ssh into
the private instance a "bastian host"

Network Access Control Lists (or "Subnet access control lists")

- security groups and NACLs provide a two layer protection
- act a bit like a network firewall
- apply rules to a whole subnet
- are "stateless" - e.g. if you want to let HTTP in and out you have to create
  two separate rules
- NACL overrides rules from a security group
- NACLs support both ALLOW and DENY rules (unlike security groups which only
  support only ALLOW rules)
- Security groups act like a firewall at the instance level whereas NACLs are an
  additional layer of security that act at the subnet level
- an ACL is
    - a numbered list of rules
    - rules are evaluated in order **starting** with lowest numbered rule and
      the first rule which matches stops evaluation (exam Q)
    - the `*` rule is the last rule evaluated
    - determines whether traffic is allowed in or out of any subnet associated
      with the ACL
    - highest number is 32766
    - suggest start with rules which are multiples of 100 to allow gaps for
      editing
    - each VPC comes with a modifiable default ACL
    - default ACL allows all inbound and outbound traffic
    - custom ACL start as fully closed (permits no traffic) by default
    - each subnet must have only one ACL
        - if you deassociate a custom NACL with a subnet the subnet will
          automatically be put back in the default NACL
    - each NACL can have 0-N subnets
    - each NACL must live in a VPC (they cannot span VPCs)
    - ACLs are stateless!
        - e.g. they can't allow a response in based on some previous request out
    - each subnet MUST be associated with one NACL
        - if you don't explicitly associate an NACL the default one will be used
    - a subnet can only be one NACL at any time
- default NACL allows all traffic inboutnd and outbound
- when you create a custom NACL all traffic inbound/outbound is blocked by
  default

## Shared responsibility model

- Aside: amazon use Xen as their hypervisor
- Aside: Amazon include RDS in their "container services"

- Amazon is responsible for the lower levels and you (cstomer) are responsibile
  for higher level
- Amazon defines three levels of shared responsibility
    1. infrastructure services e.g EC2
    2. container services e.g. RDS
    3. abstracted services e.g. S3, lambda

## misc exam q

It is possible to transfer a reserved instance from one Availability Zone to
another. = TRUE Amazon S3 buckets in all other regions (other than US Standard)
provide read-after-write consistency for PUTS of new objects. = TRUE TODO: is
there something odd about us-standard region for S3??? You can have multiple SSL
certificates (for multiple domain names) on a single Elastic Load Balancer. =
TRUE Default region for all SDKs is US-East-1 (not US-West-1 If you make an AMI
public, this AMI is immediately available across all regions, by default. =
FALSE

## Route 53 and DNS

- IPv4
    - 4 billion addresses
- IPv6
    - 340 undecillion addresses
    - route 53 supports IPv6
    - VPCs are IPv6 compatible since dec 2016 ish
        - => YOU CAN USE IPv6 fully in AWS now

SOA Record contains _ name of name server which supplied data for this zone _
admin of the zone _ current version of the data file _ timeouts for how often
secondary servers should refresh records \* default no. of seconds for TTL for
all records

Route 53 and ELB

- You cannot get the IP address for Elastic load balancers - it has one but it
  can change at any time and is hidden from your so we must use alias records
  with them

Record types

- A record ("Address" record)
    - maps domain name to IP address
- TTL Record
    - measured in seconds, says how long the record will be cached
- CName
    - moves one domain name to another
- Alias
    - a type of record amazon created
    - used to map resource record sents in your hosted zone to
        - Elastic Load Balancers
        - Cloudfront distributions
        - S3 buckets which are configured as websites
    - works like a CNAME in that it maps one DNS name to another DNS name
    - CNAME cannot be used for naked domain names (zone apex) - you cannot have
      a CNAME which map http://yoursite.com to elb1234.elb.amazonaws.com but you
      can have an ALIAS record which does

- To migrate DNS
    1. drop TTL for records to 300 secs (5 mins)
    2. wait up to 2 days for that change to propagate (old TTL can be multiple
       days)
    3. make your DNS chagne
    4. wait up to 24hrs for that to propagate
    5. Increase TTL again

Exam tips

- ELBs do not have a pre-defined IPv4 address - you resolve them using DNS name
    - Amazon uses ALIAS records for this
- Understand diff between Alias and CNAME
- Given the choice, always choose an Alias Record over a CNAME

ELB Load balancers

Two types

1. Classic load balancer
    - works at TCP layer or HTTP/HTTPS layer
2. Application load balancer
    - makes decisions at the HTTP/HTTPS layer

If you want your service to be highly available you should have a public subnet
in more than one AZ - creating an ELB will complain if you don't

You can choose to hide your contact info by enabling "Privacy protection" in
route53 while buying

You choose your routing policy when you create a record set for your domain

Route53 routing policies

1. Simple (default)
    - is the default policy
    - used when you have a single resource which performs a function for you
    - if you have multiple instances behind an ELB they will be hit in
      round-robin
2. Weighted
    - lets you split your traffic by % rather than round-robin
        - handy if you are A/B testing your service
    - the % split is over one day so a 60/40 % split won't result in 6 results
      to one and 4 results to another
        - also your ISP might be caching
        - so this split is hard to test precisely
    - you specify it by assigning a dimensionless weight number to your policy -
      the weights are evaluated relative to each other so if you only have one
      record set then it will get all the traffic
3. Latency
    - allows you to route traffic based on the lowest network latency for your
      end user
    - route53 will automatically select the resource record set which is best
      for each request which comes in
4. Failover
    - you specify both a "primary" and a "secondary" site
    - you have to setup a "health check" to check the primary site
    - allows you to create an active/passive setup
    - route53 will monitor the health of a site via a health check and it will
      send all traffic to the active site until the health check fails and then
      it will start sending traffic to the failover site
5. Geolocation
    - lets your route traffic based on the geographical location of the users
      e.g. if you want to send asian customers to a set of servers which have
      asian languages installed
    - you should create one A/ALIAS record which has the "Default" region which
      will catch-all customers who aren't in your chosen region

You add a "record set" to your domain in route53 it lets you link your domain to
some ELBs

Tip: Elastic load balancers do cost money so don't forget to delete them

DNS Exam tips

- ELBs has no public/visible IPv4 address - you can only see the domain name of
  it
    - sometimes asked as giving you possible answers which imply that you can
      see the IPv4 of an ELB
- Know the difference between A record and ALAIS
    - If given a choice, always choose an ALIAS record as they are more commonly
      useful e.g. ELBs only have an apex domain name
- Know about the 5 routing policy options
