# Services

- Elastic cloud compute (EC2)
    - virtual servers called "instances"
    - Sub service: Elastic load balancing
        - distributes incoming traffic across EC2 instances
        - provides health monitoring of running instances
        - can create "security groups" to set security options
        - can send traffic to instances in multiple AZs
        - pricing
            - pay by hour and pay by GB that is transfered through the load
              balancer
- Identity and access management (IAM)
    - does authentication and authorization
- Route53
    - A DNS service
    - Can do "latency based routing"
        - Amazon keeps a database of latency info based on ???
        - When a customer does a DNS lookup for your app to Route53 it will get
          back the IP of whichever set of your EC2 instances has the lowest
          latency for that customer
            - => only works if you have instances in multiple regions
    - Can do "weighted round-robin sets" routing
        - Presumably it sends data to each instance in turn but tweaked by the
          weighting you apply
- Glacier
    - Low cost storage for files you don't need to access very often
    - is a REST based web service (resources: vaults, archives, jobs,
      notfications)
    - vaults
        - each vault lives in a single aws region
        - each vault has a unique URL
          http://<region-specific-endpoint>/<account-id>/<vault-name>
    - There will be a delay of several hours to access files from glacier
    - "archive" is the base unit of storage. "archive" is any file (photo,
      video, document etc.)
    - archives are stored in "vaults"
    - The management console is quite limited - can only create or delete
      vaults - everything else has to be done over API (via either custom code
      or the AWS-cli tool)
    - There are SDKs for Java, .Net
    - S3 can be told to automatically archive old data to Glacier. This can save
      money but you are also charged for the transfer so be careful!
    - To get stuff out of glacier
        1. initiate a job
        2. wait for job to complete
        3. download the job output (the vaults and archives you requested)

# Managing users

There is an AWS "root" account

- you can create other "IAM" accounts that have less permissions
- Don't programmatically access the root account (similar to not SSH as root)
- Recommended to create an IAM user for myself with administrator privileges and
  use that for day-to-day work
- IAM has the notion of groups which get perms assigned
    - similar to groups on a unix box: more flexible than assigning permissions
      to a single user
- IAM users
    - Get their privileges assigned by the root user
    - Have a unique login link

# Policies

- Amazon has ~148 "policy" objects that you can "attach" to a user, group, role
- You can create your own policy objects
- A policy joins a group of "actions" with a group of "resources" via an ALLOW
  or DENY
- A policy is a JSON object
- A policy is a bit like a firewall rule - you can allow/deny access to sets of
  actions within a certain amazon service and optionally restrict to particular
  amazon resources
- A policy object can have many users/groups/roles attached and a
  user/group/role can have many policy objects attached
- A "managed policy" is one what is kept in the IAM policy repository
    - A managed policy can references up to 2 entities e.g. user/group/role.
    - Managed policies are automatically updated by Amazon when new features
      become available
- An "inline policiy" can be pasted inline into a particular user/group/role
- Policies are written in _IAM Policy Language_ (A dialect of JSON)

# Terminology

## Amazon Resource Name (ARN)

- A globally unique ID for a particular "resource"
- Resources are: users, groups, roles, ???

## Principal

- A principal is an entity in AWS that can perform actions or access resources
- A principal can be any of:
    1. An AWS account (the "root" user)
    1. An IAM user
    1. AN IAM group
    1. An IAM role
- A principal is a thing that a policy can be attached to or can be referenced
  in a policy

## Instance profile

???

## SAML

SAML 2.0 is an XML-based protocol that uses security tokens containing
assertions to pass information about a "principal" (usually an end user) between
a SAML authority, that is, an identity provider, and a SAML consumer, that is, a
service provider

# Role

- A _set of permissions_ that grant access to perform certain _actions_ and
  access _resources_
- Roles can come from
    - The AWS account you are currently in
    - Another AWS account
    - Some AWS Services e.g. EC2
    - Any 3rd party identity provider which is compatible with SAML 2.0 or
      OpenID connect
- The permissions for role `Foo` are held in a policy associated with `Foo`
- Each role has 2 policies associated with it
    1. Trust policy: who is allowed to assume the role
    2. Permissions policy: what can they do when they assume the role
        - specifies what _actions_ and _resources_ a user with the role can
          access
- Roles can be accessed in 2 ways
    1. Via the AWS web console
    2. Via the API using the AWS CLI
- Assuming a role is different in web-console and API:
    - When a principal takes on a role in the web console it loses its existing
      permissions for the duration of having the role
    - When the AWS CLI changes role via `AssumeRole` it gets a new set of
      credentials that it can use to send requests as that role - it does not
      lose its existing credentials. It "exits" the role by just not sending the
      new credentials it got with a request.
- Use cases for roles
    - Grant access to an IAM user in a different account to some actions or
      resources in your account
    - Temporairly switch roles in my own account when actions or resources
      things that are easily damaged - similar to how we use `sudo`

# Regions and availability zones

- Region = a geographic area
    - Regions are (by design) completely isolated from each other
    - Examples of _regions_:
        - eu-west-1 (Ireland)
        - ap-southeast-2 (Sydney)
    - When you view resources in the web console, you only see those defined in
      the region you have currently selected.
    - A region has multiple AZs
- Availablility zone = the data center in a specific geographic area
    - AZs within a region have low-latency links connecting them
    - AZs are architected to not go down if a different AZ goes down
    - Examples
        - The `ap-southeast-2` region (Sydney) currently has 2 AZ
            - `ap-southeast-2a`
            - `ap-southeast-2b`
- Resources can be
    1. Global examples: IAM
    2. Tied to a specific region
        - examples: S3 Bucket
    3. Tied to a specific AZ
        - examples: EC2 Instance
- How-to:
    - To see AZs: log in, choose a region from top-right, choose EC2 service.
      AZs are listed at bottom of page
- Most services support regions
- Some do not e.g. IAM
- The resources in each region are independent
- Resources are not automatically replicated across regions!
- S3
    - If you make an S3 bucket that is not in the default region you need to
      specify region in your API requests via a "location restraint" e.g. for
      Sydney it would be `ap-southeast-2`
    - The S3 console is global (you can see all regions at once)
    - Each bucket is created in a specific region
- EC2
    - When you create an instance you can choose a region _and_ an availability
      zone
    - Spreading your instances across both is a good idea for fault tolerance
    - You may not be able to choose a particular AZ if it is near capacity or
      Amazon are winding it down.
    - There does not seem to be a way to see all your EC2 instances in all
      regions at the same time
- RDS
    - a web service that lets you manage a datbase server
    - relational databases in the cloud
    - can create instances of
        - MySQL
        - Oracle
        - PostgreSQL
        - Microsoft SQL Server
    - you do not have full shell access - some advanced admin is blocked off
    - it does automated backups
    - with their "on demand" instances you pay by the hour for whatever compute
      your DB uses - the tier you pick sets max/min storage sizes
    - You can also run postgres on an EC2 instance which means you have to do
      more admin yourself but is probably bit cheaper (not verified)
    - they have their own fork of Postgres
    - > It's more oriented towards the DBA, Devops staff or Sysadmin than
      > Heroku's service
    - Have seen reports that you cannot replicate into/out of RDS - still need
      to use Postgres on EC2 for that

## Tags

- A tag is a label you apply to a resource
- tag is a case sensitive `name: value` pair
    - keys cannot bwgin with `aws:` as it is reserved
- uses:
    - categorize resources e.g. based on owner, purpose
    - ideas for tag labels:
        - Owner (who is responsibile for various resources)
        - Purpose (what business goal is this achieving)
        - Client (allows you to split up billing them based on the resources
          they use
        - Organisation section
        - Environment (production, pre-prod, staging etc.)
        - ...
- tags are used to categorize your bill so you can see how much various
  categories are costing you

- Tags also allow you to put resources into "resource groups"

# Codedeploy

- parts:
    - an agent that runs as daemon on the AWS instance OS
    - ???
- appspec.yml
    - a collection of file copy commands and shell-script run commands grouped
      into hook events
    - scripts are run in the order they appear
- AWS CodeDeploy calls a set of instances a _deployment group_.
- A deployment group contains
    - individually-tagged instances,
    - Amazon EC2 instances in Auto Scaling groups,
    - or both.
- How-to
    1. put appspec.yml in the root of your project
    1. create a zip of the project and put it on S3
    1. trigger the deploy (various methods e.g.
        - aws cli tool
        - from CI server
        - github hook
