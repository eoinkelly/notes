# S3 Web Hosting

by default when files are marked public they are reset back to private when you
upload a new version

1. enable static hosting on the bucket
2. Add a bucket policy to make items in the bucket public by default
    - see
      http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteAccessPermissionsReqd.html
    - oddly you have to explicitly reference the bucket name in the policy that
      is applied to it
    - note that bucket policy only applies to objects uploaded by the bucket
      owner - you need to use the object's ACL to make objects owned by another
      user public
    - example bucket policy
        ```json
        {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
                {
                    "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Principal": "*",
                    "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
                    "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"]
                }
            ]
        }
        ```
    ```

    ```
