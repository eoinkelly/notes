# XPath

Uses

1. find elements within an XML document
1. test whether particular element(s) exist in an XML document

Background

- A DSL for selecting nodes from an XML document
- Spec:
    - Versions (1.0 is defacto default)
        - As of 2020-04-09, current version is 3.1
          https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-3/
        - 1.0 spec: https://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116/
        - Many/most implementations only support 1.0
            - e.g. Nokogiri depends on libxml2 which supports 1.0 and has
              [no plans for 2.0 support](https://www.mail-archive.com/xml@gnome.org/msg04082.html)
              because the spec changed a lot from 1.0 to 2.0
            - e.g. Firefox Gecko implements 1.0
    - defines _path expressions_
- can be used in any XML like document: XML, HTML, SVG
- implemented in all language stacks
    - not all browsers/stacks implement **all** features
- xpath has functions e.g.
    - `position()`
        - lets you choose an element by position
    - `number()`
    - `string()`
    - `string-length()`
    - ...
- syntax
    - starting points for the search
        - `//`
            - recursive descent operator
            - starting the path with `//` means _starting anywhere within the
              document_
        - `/`
            - selects the document root
            - ignores whatever context node you might have passed in to begin
              with
    - attribute names being with `@`
    - conditions go within `[]`
        - logical AND conditions by specifying them concurrently e.g.
          `//things[@type="good"][@size="big"]` will return all `<thing>`
          elements which have an attribute `type="good"` AND `size="big"`
        - OR ?
        - NOT ?
- axes
    - there are 13 axes
    - an axis represents a relationship to the _context node_ and is used to
      locate nodes relative to that node in the tree
    - not all implementations support all axes

- models the document as a tree of nodes
- types of nodes
    1. element nodes
    1. attribute node
    1. text node
- defines a way to compute a string value for each type of node
- some types of nodes have "names"
    - a "name" is a tuple of (local-part, namespace-uri)
        - the namespace-uri can be null
- xpath expressions return one of 4 basic types when evaluated
    1. node-set
        - unordered collection of nodes **without duplicates**
    1. boolean (true or false)
    1. number ( **floating point** number)
    1. string (a sequence of **UCS** characters)
- note that "a single node" is not a basic type - nodes are always in a node-set
- expressions are evaluated with respect to a **context** (think of it like
  "context" in the sense of evaluating a function in a lang with lexical scope
- context consists of
    1. a node (the context node)
    1. a pair of non-zero positive integers (context-position, cotext-size)
        - context-position is always less than or equal to context size
    1. a set of variable bindings
        - a mapping from variable names to variable values
        - variable values can have any type valid for the return value of an
          expression **and** other types (???)
    1. a function library
        - a mapping of function names to functions
        - each function takes 0 or more args
        - each function returns one of the 4 basic types (see above)
        - the spec defines a set of core functions
        - XSLT and XPointer define additional functions and data types
    1. a set of namespace declarations in scope for the expression
        - a mapping from prefixes to namespace URIs

- the expression is a set of _location steps_ each separated by `/`
- the set of nodes selected by each step becomes the context node for the
  location step to it's right e.g.
    - example:
        ```
        a/b/c
        ```
    - the nodes selected by a become the context node for b
    - the nodes selecte by b become the context node for c and so on
- each _location step_ has 3 parts:
    1. an axis
        - specifies the _tree relationship_ between the nodes selected by this
          location step and the context node
    2. a node test
        - specifies _node type_ and _expanded name_ of the nodes selected by
          this location step
    3. 0-many predicates
        - use arbitrary expressions to further refine the set of nodes selected
