# Selenium webdriver

    QUESTIONS:
    can i get firefox to open with the dev tools open
    why does binding.pry lock up firefox in an rspec test
    can i not kill the browser when the test finishes
        to allow setting up the browser for manual testing

- Webdriver is a W3C spec
    - https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html
    - lots of the terminology e.g "session", comes from the spec
- Selenium existed before the WebDriver spec
    - but it now includes an implementation of that spec in Selenium version 2
- Selenium webdriver docs
    - http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.jsp
- Each browser has a driver

Objects

Driver _ usually a single instance of a driver that represents the connection to
the browser WebElement _ the driver provides "finders" which return instances of
web elements

You can find elements by

1. CSS
    - uses built-in browser CSS selector support
1. name attribute
1. id attribute
1. class attribute
1. link text
1. partial link text
1. xpath
