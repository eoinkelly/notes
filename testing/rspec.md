# RSpec

## 6 Gems

- RSpec is split into 6 separate gems.
- `gem install rspec` will install them all

1. rspec
2. rspec-core
3. rspec-support
4. rspec-mocks
5. rspec-expectations
6. rspec-rails

## 8 Kinds of tests

There are 8 kinds of spec in rails + rspec:

1. feature specs
    - Make a feature spec:`RSpec.describe 'blah', type: :feature do`
    - Adding `type: :feature` makes some methods available to you in the block
      that help with writing tests from the POV of a browser.
        - these methods are the _Capybara DSL_
    - live in `spec/features` by default
    - manipulates a "fake browser" provided by Capybara
    - _requires_ Capybara. Feature specs are skipped if you do not have Capybara
      installed!
    - Capybara provides aliases for existing Rspec methods:
        - `feature` for `describe`
            - automatically sets `type: :feature`
        - `scenario` for `it`
2. request specs
    - Make a request spec:`RSpec.describe 'blah', type: :request do`
    - Adding `type: :request` makes some methods available to you in the block
      that help with writing tests from the POV of a browser.
        - these methods are the _Capybara DSL_
    - live in `spec/requests` by default
    - they exercise the full rails stack (routing -> controllers -> models)
      without stubbing.
    - are a middle-ground between feature specs and controller specs
        - they are not from the POV of a user with a browser - you don't make
          assertions about the contents of the HTML returned
    - are an alternative to feature specs. Heres how they compare:
        - request specs are faster than feature specs because they don't have to
          use all the "fake browser" machinery
        - request specs are not _true_ end-to-end tests for a normal web page
          e.g.
            - they don't test any JS you might have on your page
            - they don't make it easy to assert the contents of the DOM in the
              response (they only provide the response as a String object)
        - If you are testing an JSON API then request specs and feature specs
          are much more similar (no HTML DOM, no client-side JS)
    - are a _very_ thin wrapper around the integration testing API provided by
      rails so basically their docs are the rails integration testing API docs
        - see
          [http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html#integration-testing](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html#integration-testing)
3. controller specs
    - Make a controller spec: `RSpec.describe 'blah', type: :controller do`
    - Adding `type: :controller` makes some methods available to you in the
      block that help with testing controllers
    - live in `spec/controllers` by default
    - never create HTTP requests
    - do not render views by default
    - you can inspect the instance variables assigned by the controller
        ```
        expect(assigns(:some_ivar)).to eq(some_value)
        ```
4. model specs
    - Make a model spec: `RSpec.describe 'blah', type: :model do`
    - No extra methods available ??? CHECK THIS!
    - live in `spec/models` by default
5. view specs
    - rarely used
6. helper specs
    - rarely used
7. routing specs
    - rarely used
8. mailer specs
    - rarely used

You can just include normal ruby modules in a describe block

```ruby
module UsersSteps
  def sign_in; end
  def submit_form; end
end

RSpec.describe 'blah', type: :feature do
  include UsersSteps
end
```

Aliases:

- describe, context, feature (from Capybara)
- it, specify, scenario (from Capybara)

There are 14 rspec matchers that can take matchers as arguments

Array, String

4. end_with(matcher, matcher, ...)
5. start_with(matcher, matcher, ...)

Array

3. contain_exactly(matcher, matcher, matcher)

Array, Hash, String (anything that responds to #include?

5. include(matcher, matcher, ...)
6. include(:key => matcher, :other => matcher)

7. change { }.by(matcher)
8. change { }.from(matcher).to(matcher)
9. match(arbitrary_nested_structure_with_matchers)
10. output(matcher).to_stdout
11. output(matcher).to_stderr
12. raise_error(ErrorClass, matcher)
13. throw_symbol(:sym, matcher)
14. yield_with_args(matcher, matcher, ...)
15. yield_successive_args(matcher, matcher, ...)
