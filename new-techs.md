Evaluating new technologies

Be mindful of the adoption lifecycle

Is this the right time? _ Does the current economics of CPU/memory/bandwidth
support adoption of this tech? _ Is this the right tech at the wrong time? \*
What would need to change in the economics of compute/bandwidth etc. to make
this work? Because that's what might make it work next time

Is it a platform or a feature?

Is it a big enough improvement to drive change behaviour? a 20% decrease in cost
probably won't motivate change 50%+ does

Does it remove significant barriers to how we used to do it?
