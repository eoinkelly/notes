## Background

A solvent is something which dissolves some other substance resulting in a "solution" e.g.
turpentine will dissolve paint resulting in a substance which is an even mixture of paint+turpentine
(called the solution)

> The term 'solvents' refers to a class of chemical compounds described by function. Solvents, which
> are generally in liquid form, are used to dissolve, suspend or extract other materials, usually
> without chemically changing either the solvents or the other materials.

The two elements in a _solution_ are **not** chemically bound together - it may be possible to
separate the elements e.g. if they boil at different temperatures.

If two elements are combined in a chemically bound way it is called a _compound_ not a _solution_

A chemically bound combination of multiple atoms of the same element is just called a molecule not a
compound e.g. $O_{2}$

## Methylated spirit (organic)

-   https://www.sydneysolvents.com.au/methylated-spirits
-   Flash point 11 degC
-   Also known as
    -   grain alcohol
    -   denatured alcohol (the denaturant is added to prevent it being consumed)
        -   bitrex is sometimes the denaturant
    -   is not petroleum based
-   Can be different concentrations
-   95% ethanol and 5% methanol with a dye to colour it.
    -   Pure ethanol is very valuable and for economic reasons the government treats it like
        currency.
    -   The addition of methanol makes "denatured" alcohol impossible to "counterfiet".
-   almost pure alcohol with stuff added to deter human consumption
-   you don't have to pay taxes for transporting alcohol since you can't drink it.
-   dye can be pyridine
-   purpose of dye is to stop it tasting OK if you drink it
-   The methanol does not change the chemical properties of the ethanol and is nearly impossible to
    remove.
-   Uses
    -   solvent for paint
    -   Sterilise equipment
    -   Window cleaner
    -   can be burned in heaters
    -   solvent (dissolves) paints, varnishes, lacquers
    -   spray and wipe disinfectant
    -   cosmetics and make-up cleaner
    -   can be used as a "rubbing alcohol" when dulted down to 65-70%
        -   dilute to make it less harsh on skin and longer surface time to kill germs
-   safety
    -   is toxic
    -   **can be absorbed through the skin**

### Surgical spirit (organic)

-   Same as Methylated spirit but no dye

## Isopropyl alcohol (organic)

-   https://www.sydneysolvents.com.au/solvents/isopropyl-alcohol/
-   Also known as
    -   Rubbing alcohol (the 70% variant only)
    -   IPA
-   Is miscible in water so you can dilute it to your needs
-   flashpoint 12 degC - highly flammable
-   3 main kinds (defined by how much water added)
    1.  70% (used for massage and to disinfect wounds)
        -   higher moisture content makes it better for disinfecting because it stays on surface
            longer
    1.  99%
    1.  100%
-   Uses
    -   70%
        -   Massage. Others are not used because:
            -   methanol is poisonous and can be absorbed through skin
            -   Ethanol is very expensive
        -   toxic to drink, harmless applied to skin
    -   99%,100%
        -   evaporates very quickly - good for cleaning
        -   cleaning electronics, mirrors, stainless steel
        -   remove sticky residue
        -   disinfecting
        -   hand sanitizer

## Turpentines

### Pure/Gum/Vegetable turpentine (organic)

-   is a fluid obtained by the distillation of resin obtained from live trees, mainly pines -
    composed of terpenes
-   > Wood turpentine is obtained by the steam distillation of dead, shredded bits of pine wood,
    > while gum turpentine results from the distillation of the exudate of the living pine tree
    > obtained by tapping
-   artists use as a paint thinner for oil paints
-   very expensive compared to these other solvents

### Mineral turpentine (hydrocarbon)

-   is a clear, colorless liquid that is distilled from crude petroleum.
-   It is composed mainly of aliphatic and alicyclic hydrocarbons, and it has a strong, pungent
    odor.
-   https://www.sydneysolvents.com.au/mineral-turpentine
-   Also known as
    -   turps
    -   turpentine substitute
-   is an organic solvent - it not derived from petroleum
-   does not contain any alcohol
-   highly flammable
    -   flashpoint at 31 degC
    -   flashpoint = the temp at which vapours will ignite in the presence of an ignition source
-   uses
    -   cleaning brushes
    -   thin oil based paint (not recommended by artists tho - see the section below)
    -   used to be burned in lamps as alternative to whale oil
    -   remove waxes and polishes
    -   a degreasing solvent
    -   degreaser for tools and parts
    -   cleaning painting tools
    -   has more "solvency" than methylated spirits i.e. it has greater ability to dissolved with
        other solvents
    -   more dangerous than meths
-   Aside: camphene is a blend of ethanol and turpentine - was the dominant lamp fuel until the
    advent of kerosene so

### Mineral turpentine vs Pure/Gum/Vegetable Turpentine

-   Mineral turpentine is good for cleaning brushes but terrible for thinning paint
    -   it will thin paint but robs the pigment of protection
-   Pure/Gum turpentine is a good for thinning paint
    -   this is the one that is distilled from pine tree sap
    -   thins the paint but the residue creates a UV barrier to protect the paint and stop it
        cracking
    -   strong sweet smell
    -   a lot more expensive than regular turpentine so artists use it only to thin paint

## White Spirit (hydrocarbon)

-   https://www.sydneysolvents.com.au/white-spirit
-   Also known as
    -   Mineral spirit
    -   Paint thinner
-   is a hydrocarbon - petroleum based like turpentine
-   flashpoint 42 degC
-   mixes well with other solvents
-   A typical composition for mineral spirits is > 65% C10 or higher hydrocarbons,[6] aliphatic
    solvent hexane, and a maximum benzene content of 0.1% by volume.
-   basically distilled refined kerosene.
-   designed as a a cheap substitute for Turpentine
    -   (turpentine has better solvent power, is more environmentally friendly)
-   uses
    -   thin out oil-based paint
    -   remove waxes, stains, polishes
    -   degreasing
    -   used **in** paints, lacquers, varnish and asphalt as a thinner
-   works similarly to turpentine
    -   turpentine is considered more dangerous (irritates skin & eyes more, more flammable)
-   Artists use white spirit as an alternative to turpentine since it is less flammable and less
    toxic.
    -   Because of interactions with pigments in oil paints, artists require a higher grade of white
        spirit than many industrial users, including the complete absence of residual sulfur.

## Acetone (hydrocarbon)

-   https://www.sydneysolvents.com.au/acetone
-   CAUTION: Can dissolve guitar finishes and melt lacquer and plastics - careful!
-   miscible in water so can be diluted
-   mixes well with other solvents
-   uses
    -   Removing and clean-up of nail polish
    -   dissolve superglue for clean-up
    -   nail polish remover
    -   cleaning engine parts (auto parts cleaners can be replaced with straight acetone
    -   a "shellac and SNS soaker" for nail polish
    -   melt styroforam
    -   remove paint from windows
    -   clean an dsanitize surfaces
    -   erase permanent marker

Acetone is a hydrocarbon. Many plastics are also hydrocarbons.

If acetone comes into contact with the plastics below, you can expect a severe effect, especially at
a high concentration and over a long time. The chemical makeup of these plastics is too similar to
acetone to resist it. The acetone will damage the plastic's surface, softening it, smearing it, or
even dissolving the plastic.

1. PVDF
1. Polycarbonate
1. Polysulfone
1. Cast Acrylic
1. PVC
1. CPVC

Acetone can dissolve these plastics but once the acetone "flashes off" you get the hard plastic
again - the plastic molecules are not changed. You can do a form of "plastic welding" with it.

## Naphtha

-   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naphtha (<-- not great)
-   carcinogenic
-   not sold in the US to walk-in customers anymore (still used in making paint and varnish I
    believe)

> generally, it is a fraction of crude oil, but it can also be produced from natural-gas
> condensates, petroleum distillates, and the fractional distillation of coal tar and peat. In some
> industries and regions, the name naphtha refers to crude oil or refined petroleum products such as
> kerosene or diesel fuel.

> Naphtha is also known as Shellite in Australia ?are they the same thing?

-   Example: https://www.laballey.com/products/naphtha-vmandp
    -   an aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent mixture distilled from petroleum.
    -   Its characteristics are similar to Mineral Spirits, although it is more volatile and dries
        faster.
    -   It has a nice sweet odor and is suitable for most solvent-based finishes, making it a
        popular choice for long-term applications.
    -   It operates similarly to lighter fluid and is an excellent solvent for removing sticky or
        label residue.
    -   Because of its low flash point, VM&P Naphtha is very flammable at room temperature.

## Which solvents are best for which jobs

> Mineral turpentine is chemically very different from turpentine, which mainly consists of pinene,
> and it has inferior solvent properties

> White spirit is a far cleaner and better thinners than turps, and to the touch feels less oily. In
> painting decorators usually shy away from turps in favour of white spirit for this reason.

> Natural turpentine is a totally different beast, practically useless as a thinner in paints but a
> brilliant binder for pigments as in artists oils. It is also used for making polishes when mixed
> with waxes.

?? distilled turpentine deterioates in storage

? do i need artist grade white spriit

sansodor (?brand)

Acetone

-   dissovlves superglue/epoxy before it hardens
-   wipe down metals
-   remove oils from oily woods
-   bonds with oil and water

Denatured Alcohol

-   good for cleaning glass because it evaporates quick enough not to leave streaks

Naphtha

-   stronger
-   faster evaporating
-   removes wax and oily clean up
-

Evaporation rate is one of the main reasons there are so many products e.g. super fast drying might
leave brush strokes in your paint slow drying picks up more dirt & dust

All these solvents are good for cleaning wood because unlike water it doesn't cause it to swell
