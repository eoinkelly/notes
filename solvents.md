## Background

A solvent is something which dissolves some other substance resulting in a
"solution" e.g. turpentine will dissolve paint resulting in a substance which is
an even mixture of paint+turpentine (called the solution)

The two elements in a _solution_ are **not** chemically bound together - it may be possible to separate the elements e.g. if they boil at different temperatures.

If two elements are combined in a chemically bound way it is called a _compound_ not a _solution_

A chemically bound combination of multiple atoms of the same element is just called a molecule not a compound e.g. $O_{2}$

## Methylated spirit (organic)

-   https://www.sydneysolvents.com.au/methylated-spirits
-   Flash point 11 degC
-   Also known as
    -   grain alcohol
    -   denatured alcohol (the denaturant is added to prevent it being consumed)
        -   bitrex is sometimes the denaturant
    -   is not petroleum based
-   Can be different concentrations
-   95% ethanol and 5% methanol with a dye to colour it.
    -   Pure ethanol is very valuable and for economic reasons the government treats it like currency.
    -   The addition of methanol makes "denatured" alcohol impossible to "counterfiet".
-   almost pure alcohol with stuff added to deter human consumption
-   you don't have to pay taxes for transporting alcohol since you can't drink it.
-   dye can be pyridine
-   purpose of dye is to stop it tasting OK if you drink it
-   The methanol does not change the chemical properties of the ethanol and is nearly impossible to remove.
-   Uses
    -   solvent for paint
    -   Sterilise equipment
    -   Window cleaner
    -   can be burned in heaters
    -   solvent (dissolves) paints, varnishes, lacquers
    -   spray and wipe disinfectant
    -   cosmetics and make-up cleaner
    -   can be used as a "rubbing alcohol" when dulted down to 65-70%
        -   dilute to make it less harsh on skin and longer surface time to kill germs
-   safety
    -   is toxic
    -   **can be absorbed through the skin**

### Surgical spirit (organic)

-   Same as Methylated spirit but no dye

## Isopropyl alcohol (organic)

-   https://www.sydneysolvents.com.au/solvents/isopropyl-alcohol/
-   Also known as
    -   Rubbing alcohol (the 70% variant only)
    -   IPA
-   Is miscible in water so you can dilute it to your needs
-   flashpoint 12 degC - highly flammable
-   3 main kinds (defined by how much water added)
    1.  70% (used for massage and to disinfect wounds)
        -   higher moisture content makes it better for disinfecting because it stays on surface longer
    1.  99%
    1.  100%
-   Uses
    -   70%
        -   Massage. Others are not used because:
            -   methanol is poisonous and can be absorbed through skin
            -   Ethanol is very expensive
        -   toxic to drink, harmless applied to skin
    -   99%,100%
        -   evaporates very quickly - good for cleaning
        -   cleaning electronics, mirrors, stainless steel
        -   remove sticky residue
        -   disinfecting
        -   hand sanitizer

## Mineral turpentine (organic)

-   https://www.sydneysolvents.com.au/mineral-turpentine
-   Also known as
    -   turps
-   is an organic solvent - it not derived from petroleum
-   is a fluid obtained by the distillation of resin obtained from live trees, mainly pines - composed of terpenes
-   > Wood turpentine is obtained by the steam distillation of dead, shredded bits of pine wood, while gum turpentine results from the distillation of the exudate of the living pine tree obtained by tapping
-   contains "turpenes"
-   does not contain any alcohol
-   highly flammable
    -   flashpoint at 31 degC
    -   flashpoint = the temp at which vapours will ignite in the presence of an ignition source
-   uses
    -   cleaning brushes
    -   thinning pigments
    -   thin oil based paint
    -   used to be burned in lamps as alternative to whale oil
    -   remove waxes and polishes
    -   a degreasing solvent
    -   degreaser for tools and parts
    -   cleaning painting tools
    -   has more "solvency" than methylated spirits i.e. it has greater ability to dissolved with other solvents
    -   more dangerous than meths
-   Aside: camphene is a blend of ethanol and turpentine
    -   was teh dominant lamp fuel until the advent of kerosene
so
## White Spirit (hydrocarbon)

-   https://www.sydneysolvents.com.au/white-spirit
-   Also known as
    -   Mineral spirit
    -   Paint thinner
-   is a hydrocarbon - petroleum based like turpentine
-   flashpoint 42 degC
-   mixes well with other solvents
-   A typical composition for mineral spirits is > 65% C10 or higher hydrocarbons,[6] aliphatic solvent hexane, and a maximum benzene content of 0.1% by volume.
-   basically distilled refined kerosene.
-   designed as a a cheap substitute for Turpentine
    -   (turpentine has better solvent power, is more environmentally friendly)
-   uses
    -   thin out oil-based paint
    -   remove waxes, stains, polishes
    -   degreasing
    -   used **in** paints, lacquers, varnish and asphalt as a thinner
-   works similarly to turpentine
    -   turpentine is considered more dangerous (irritates skin & eyes more, more flammable)

## Acetone (hydrocarbon)

-   https://www.sydneysolvents.com.au/acetone
-   CAUTION: Can dissolve guitar finishes and melt lacquer and plastics - careful!
-   miscible in water so can be diluted
-   mixes well with other solvents
-   uses
    -   Solvent for nail polish
    -   cleaning up superglue and residue
    -   nail polish remover
    -   cleaning engine parts
    -   a "shellac and SNS soaker" for nail polish
    -   melt styroforam
    -   remove paint from windows
    -   clean an dsanitize surfaces
    -   erase permanent marker

Acetone is a hydrocarbon. Many plastics are also hydrocarbons.

If acetone comes into contact with the plastics below, you can expect a severe
effect, especially at a high concentration and over a long time. The chemical
makeup of these plastics is too similar to acetone to resist it. The acetone
will damage the plastic's surface, softening it, smearing it, or even dissolving
the plastic.

1. PVDF
1. Polycarbonate
1. Polysulfone
1. Cast Acrylic
1. PVC
1. CPVC

Acetone can dissolved these plastics but once the acetone "flashes off" (???
correct term?) you get the hard plastic again - the plastic molecules are not
changed.
