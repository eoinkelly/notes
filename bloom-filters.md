# Bloom filters

- a data structure
- usually implemented as a vector or array of bits
- used to test whether an element is a member of a set
- space efficient - use when it would not be practical to use a standard hash or
  set data structure
- can have false positives, cannot have false negatives
- when you query the structure for element X you get back one of
    - X is definitely not in the set
    - X is possibly in the set (can't be sure we don't have a false positive)
- elements can be added to the set but not removed
    - if you use a _counting filter_ then you can also remove elements from the
      structure
- concieved by Howard Bloom in 1970
- variations that store TTL values with each bit exist and are useful for very
  fast/large datastreams where a normal bloom filter would fill up and give all
  false positives too soon
- bloom filters have a maximum on the number of things you can add - a "strict"
  variant prevents you from adding too many
- usage ideas:
    - use a bloom filter as the first step in a search or a huge set of logs
      .e.g we have N directories of daily log files and we are looking for a
      particular name so maintain N bloom filters (one per day) that can be
      searched first and will weed out days that don't include the search term.

> fewer than 10 bits per element are required for a 1% false positive
> probability, independent of the size or number of elements in the set

## Implementations

- Ruby
    - https://github.com/igrigorik/bloomfilter-rb
        - the redis backend adds an order of magnitude to the storage
          requirements
        - a similar approach could be used without redis (just using a timestamp
        - includes a counting filter implementation
    - https://github.com/colinsurprenant/bloombroom
    - https://github.com/deepfryed/bloom-filter
        - less full-featured than bloomfilter-rb
- Javascript
    - Node can implement them using Buffers or using redis as back-end
    - There are a few things on npm
