# Misc

I need a ruler that goes to 10th of a mm

?? Given all this stuff is american, are inches the defacto standard?
Recommend a machinst ruler in 1/32 and 1/64 of inches


Tools I want to have

1. Better small snips (? I already have a snips but it's not great)
2. String action ruler gauge tool
    1. need small increments (down to 1/64th of an inch)
    2. needs to start flush at edge
3. Understring radius guage set
4. String radius gauge (square thingy) with notches cut out for the strings

?? maybe a little pick to get gunk out from under the frets - some sort of dentist tool
some sort of soft towel mat
a neck holder - could be wood or stuffed fabric
some small allen keys to adjust intonation etc.

Don't use oil or solvents on a maple neck - it's fine to use on rosewood

Tools I have

1. Long straight ruler (can use Amelia's)
