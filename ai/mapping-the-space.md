Ways to intereact

As a prompter
writing prompts and uploading/downloading files in a UI, voice also possible now

As a developer
hitting the API endpoints provided by

Layers of what you can hit

The LLM itself e.g. "The generic ChatGPT4 provided by OpenAI"
A customised copy of the LLM
Chat GPT "apps" are tweaked via UI
More detailed: train via few shot training
Yet more detailed: tweak the training of an AWS foundation model

Does anybody train a model from scratch for production use? Seems not?

```
Q: what are model cards?
    claude 2: https://www-files.anthropic.com/production/images/ModelCardClaude2_with_appendix.pdf?dm=1700589594
```

?? rank each model based on features? or rank each company based on what problems they address?

### Builder products

### Chatbot product

### Integrations with other products

-   OpenAI is the basis for Microsoft Copilot and Github copilot

## Model vendor: Anthropic

### Company

-   Model versioning policy: ???
-   Customise behaviour only by prompting
-   Patrons: Amazon (1.25bn), Google (2bn)
-   Funding (circa end 2023): 3.3bn

### Available models

1. Claude
    - 200k tokens (~150k words) context window
    - available in AWS Bedrock as a fully managed service
    - Fine-tuning only by request for enterprise customers or now through AWS Bedrock
    - cannot do embeddings but they recommend open source SBERT
    - comment: AWS Bedrock helps fill out a number of gaps in Claude offering vs ChatGPT
1. Claude Instant
    - faster, cheaper, less accurate

### Builder products

-   You have to submit a "business interest" form to use Claude directly OR you can use AWS Bedrock. Bedrock seems to be the main way you can use Claude in a product.

### Chatbot product

-   URL: https://claude.ai/chat/
-   File uploads: Yes
-   Login via login code to email only. Bah.
-   Speech input: No
-   needs sign-up (need to provide phone number too :-( )
-   Versions
    -   Free
    -   Pro
        -   $20 USD/month
        -   Higher priority, faster access to new features, more usage credits
    -   They call it an "open beta"

### Integrations with other products

    -   models (with git version control)
    -   datasets
    -   running small scale web applications e.g. demos - these are called _Spaces_
        -   > We currently support two awesome Python SDKs (Gradio and Streamlit) that let you build cool apps in a matter of minutes. Users can also create static Spaces which are simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript page within a Space.
