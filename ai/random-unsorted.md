Model management

whole model lifecycle

train collect dataset choose algo save model evaluate push to prod iterate
consider challengers

be able to handle an audit - demonstrate how the model was trained and evaluated

regulated envs are using ML but not LLMs beause they can't manage the risk there
is no worled in which they can use openai (or anything that moves data out of
their env)
