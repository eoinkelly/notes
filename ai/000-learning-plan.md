# Learning Plan

Goals

- Be able to build a recommender that doesn't suck too much
- Be able to build search that doesn't suck too much

Possible things to learn from:

- Book: Programming Collective intelligence
- Coursera: machine learning
- Udacity: introduction to AI
- Coursera: Master Recommender systems
    - https://www.coursera.org/specializations/recommender-systems
- Book: Collective intelligence in action

## Questions

## Other thoughts

- Machines won't reason like we do, just as birds and planes fly differently
- For a recommendation engine:
    - First important choice for us to make is how to capture the preference as
      a number

- Idea: run some ml on all rabid git commits to get interesting data

What are the available layers of ML (as I understand it on 2017-04-09)?

- Layer: anything higher currently?
- Layer: google's ML rest apis (you just upload an image, text, audio and it
  returns results)
- Layer: layers in between?
- Layer: tensorflow
    - which itself has layers (Core API and contrib stuff on top of that)
- Layer: using linear algebra libs in some programming language to implement
  algorithms you write yourself
