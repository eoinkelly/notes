# Learning Plan

Goals

* Be able to build a recommender that doesn't suck too much
* Be able to build search that doesn't suck too much

Possible things to learn from:

* Book: Programming Collective intelligence
* Coursera: machine learning
* Udacity: introduction to AI
* Coursera: Master Recommender systems
    * https://www.coursera.org/specializations/recommender-systems
* Book: Collective intelligence in action
    * https://www.manning.com/books/collective-intelligence-in-action

## Questions

## Other thoughts

* Machines won't reason like we do, just as birds and planes fly differently
* For a recommendation engine:
    * First important choice for us to make is how to capture the preference as a number

* Idea: run some ml on all rabid git commits to get interesting data

##

What are the available layers of ML (as I understand it on 2017-04-09)?

* Layer: anything higher currently?
* Layer: google's ML rest apis (you just upload an image, text, audio and it returns results)
* Layer: layers in between?
* Layer: tensorflow
    * which itself has layers (Core API and contrib stuff on top of that)
* Layer: using linear algebra libs in some programming language to implement algorithms you write yourself
