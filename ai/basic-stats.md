# Basic stats refresher

Correlation coefficient $r$

* a unitless number which describes how well a **linear** model describes a function or _how well does a line fit this data on a graph?_
* $r$ has range from -1 to 1
    * 1 $\implies$ a perfect positive correlation (the output $y$ values increase as the input $x$ values increase)
    * 0 $\implies$ no correlation i.e. a **linear** model is a shite way to model this function
    * -1 $\implies$ a perfect negative correlation (the output $y$ values decrease as the input $x$ values increase)

## box & whisker plots (or "box plots")

* the thin lines (whiskers) show the full range of the data (from the highest to lowest value)
    * aside: in stats "range" is `maxValue - minValue`
* the box
* the line within the box is the median value
    * the median is the value where half the values measured fall on either side of it
* each edge of the box is the median for all the values between the start of the range and the overall median
* the box and whisker plot splits the range (the whisker to whisker distance) into 4 sections
    "first quartile" = from start of whisker to start of box"

### central tendency

Arithmetic Mean

* also called the "average"

Median

* a measure of "central tendency" of a dataset
* To calculate median value for a set of values
    1. arrange values in order
        2a. if odd number of values then median is the middle number
        2b. if even number of values then median is the arithmetic mean (average) of the two middle numbers
* Implications: You can have a median value which is not one of the values of the dataset!

Mode

* the number which shows up the most
