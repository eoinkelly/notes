# Introduction to Statistical Learning

- A less mathematically focused version of _Elements of Statistical learning_
  book

## Statistical learning

- refers to a large toolkit for modeling and understanding **complex** data sets
- is a recently developed area of statistics
- blends with comp sci especially machine learning
- things which are in statistical learning
    - lasso
    - sparse regression
    - classification
    - regression trees
    - boosting
    - support vector machines
- has two main areas
    1. supervised learning
        - build a _model_ for estimating an output given one or more inputs
        - there is a "supervising output" i.e. we have examples where we know
          what the output value should be for a given set of inputs and we can
          use these examples to compare with our model and make it better
    2. unsupervised learning
        - there are inputs but no supervising output
        - we are trying to discover relationships and structures in the data
