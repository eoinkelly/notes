# Image generation

Publicly available image generator models. They take a text prompt and generate an image.

1. Stable Diffusion
    - Open source
        - so you can run it in many ways, including locally
    - Latest model is `Stable Diffusion XL`
    - you can train it on your own images
    - Created by StabilityAI who make two interfaces available
        1. https://clipdrop.co/
            - requires NZD 15/month subscription to use the XL model
            - includes a bunch of other image manipulation tools, not just image generation - this is the most featureful UI I have seen for these tools.
        2. https://dreamstudio.ai/generate
            - Art generation only
            - Has the ability to edit mage but not sure if it's follow-up prompts or not

2. DALL-E 3
    - Only available to ChatGPT Plus subscribers
    - you can use follow-up prompts to tweak the generated artwork
    - -- it generates new images every prompt (using your previous prompts as context) rather than using older images as input - this means edits can be surprising
