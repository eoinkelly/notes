# Integration testing in JS

There are 2 families

1. test sits on the page with the app
2. test sits in node/browser and remote controls another browser

they are differtiated by where the test lives relative to the app

# Options

The options are:

1. remote-control a browser via the WebDriver protocol
2. hook in at the JS framework level (if any)
    - -- only works for frameworks that support it
    - -- different for each framework
    - ?? AFAIK ember is the only framework to do this
    - ember runs itself in a div on a page surrounded by the test harness HTML
        - the ember test helpers (visit, andThen, find etc.) let you manipulate
          the active route and read and change the DOM under the ember root
        - the ember assertion helpers let you inspect the state of your ember
          app to make assertions about it at various points
        - ember runs its integration tests on page rather than trying to remote
          control a browser - pros/cons:
            - does not use webdriver
            - ++ no java server required
            - ?? can interactions that open new windows/popups be tested e.g. a
              facebook login
            - ++ faster than using selenium because you are not booting a whole
              new browser process
            - ?? how does it work when testing multiple browsers?
            - embers test.html loads testem javascript as well as the ember app
        - so in a way the ember app is remote-controlling itself and everything
          is just running in the browser
3. testem
    - is basically just a runner that will re-run things when some files change
    - knows how to run 2 types of thing:
        1. browsers
            - it creates a HTTP server and sends the browser to it. Form there
              it injects an iframe on the page and communicates back to the
              server via websockets
            - it has special knowledge of where to find the browser process on
              your machine (as it knows your architecture)
            - does not autolanuch browsers unless you tell it to
        2. normal processes
            - it captures STDOUT of the process
            - => it can be a runner for any process you want e.g. test ruby,
              shellscripts etc.
    - how testem runs browser tests:
        - when you run testem, it sets up a HTTP server at
          `http://localhost:7357/`
        - when you hit that server with a browser it redirect you to whatever
          url you configured e.g. `/tests/index.html?hidepassed%`
        - testem intercepts console output and window.onerror and sends those to
          its server via a websockets connection
        - The "TEST'EM SCRIPTS" thing you see on the page is from the testem
          iframe
        - The client-side script that reports results back to the Testem server
          via Socket.IO.
        - It also restarts the tests by refreshing the page when instructed by
          the server to do so.
        - it loads /testem/connection.html into an iframe
        - things the testem iframe does:
            ```js
            takeOverConsole();
            interceptWindowOnError();
            initTestFrameworkHooks(Testem);
            setupTestStats();
            ```
    - it can function as a proxy for API calls from your app to an API server on
      the Internet
    - it can run preprocessors on your files before running the tests
4. Karma
    - seems to be very similar architecture to testem
    - does not seem to be super active recently
    - angular team recommend karma for running unit tests and protractor for
      running e2e tests
        - why? what are the advantages of the selenium method

### testem pros/cons vs webdriver

- -1 testem: testem can't run the same tests locally and on a remote machine
- +1 testem: testem doesn't require any special browser driver
- ?? how does it handle multiple window tests e.g. a facebook login
- ?? testem might be faster than webdriver?
- +1 testem: it is much easier/acutally possible to pause a test in the middle
  and inspect what is happening
- +1 testem: it allows you to see your console.log output in the terminal which
  makes debugging easier. if you run selenium locally in a real browser (not
  phantom) you can pause the code and use the dev tools to debug stuff
- +1 selenum: your tests run in node (or ruby), not the browser which can be an
  easier dev experience
- -1 testem: selenium enforces more isolation between your test and the app - it
  is easier to cheat with testem
- Tests are different in tone: testem runs tests beside your app in a browser,
  webdriver tests control the browser to test your app
    - In testem tests, your POV is "I am on the page _with_ the app - I can
      control it and read info from it"
        - this is a similar POV that we are used to from in-browser testing
          frameworks like jasmine/qunit
    - In webdriver tests, your POV is "I am using HTTP commands to
      remote-control the browser - i send commands and check responses to make
      assertions"

## options for selenium client

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-webdriver
    - official selenium JS driver
    - good reference docs, no great tutorials
    - ++ does not need a selenium server when running locally - it runs and
      talks directly to the drivers
        - needs a selenium server when connecting to a browser on a remote host
        - ?? does this make it quicker than the alternatives when running
          locally
    - ++ uses promises for everything
- webdriver.io
    - controls a selenium server via the JSON wire protocol
    - no assertion framework built-in
    - -- puts the commands you give it on a a "command queue" that gets executed
      asynchonrously - this makes is harder to share data between the callbacks
    - -- no promises API, callbacks only. makes tests very nested
    - predates the official WebDriverJS client (webdriver used to be called
      webdriverjs prior to 2.0)
    - talks webdriver HTTP protocol to the java server
- nightwatch
    - controls a selenium server via the HTTP protocol
    - has an assertion framework built-in
    - will start selenium server for you
    - has a test runner built-in e.g. does berforeEach etc.
    - since end of 2013
    - talks webdriver-wire-protocol directly
- protractor
    - controls a selenium server
    - does not provide a test framework - can integrate with others
    - -- they focus very much on angular - it may work but they make no
      garuantees (https://github.com/angular/protractor/issues/1507)
    - a wrapper around WebDriverJS
- Intern
    - seems very complete/very huge
    - also provides unit testing
    - returns promises for everything
    - built on the webdriver standard i.e. uses selenium
    - > Native mobile application UIs can be tested by Intern using an Appium,
      > ios-driver, or Selendroid
    - uses AMD modules
    - uses selenium
- Casper
    - -- phantomjs only
- Capybara
    - in ruby
    - -- async waits are really tricky

A key question for the "selenium family" of testing is which libary is the
easiest to work with \* is testing JS with ruby an ok idea? that q boils down to
"how does capybara compare to the JS options as a testing lib?"

## Cloud based selenium servers

- BrowserStack
- Sauce Labs
- TestingBot

## Ways of using selenium server from JS

- Official way is WebDriverJS
  https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs
- is `selenium-webdriver` on npm
- has `/remote` module for controlling the standalone selenium server
- uses promises

- the wire protocol used between selenium server and client is specified by W3C
  now

- all the selenium based solutions rely on polling to know how long to wait for
  async operations

challenges for these things

- how does it handle popup windows like how FB auth works in browser
- how does it handle asynchonous operations or operations that take a "long"
  time

Aside: sources of async in the browser

- XHR
- setTimeout
- setInterval
- IndexedDB
- DOMMutationObservers
- postMessage
- ??? others

90% of async in ember apps is XHR, setTimout, run loop

# Selenium architecture

WebDriver is a compact Object Oriented API the `selenium-webdriver` gem/npm
package provides an OO API for controlling the webdriver

## JSON Wire protocol

- the protocol spoken between "selenium-client" and "selenium-server"
- https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol
- a RESTful web service providing JSON over HTTP
- In selenium protocol terminology "session" and "browser" are 1:1
- There are ~100 commands in the wire protocol
- Protocol command reference:
  https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol#Command_Reference

## "selenium-http" clients

- The various `selenium-webdriver` gem/npm packages etc. are basically fancy
  HTTP clients
- they convert the OO commands our code gives them into the appropriate HTTP req
  for an endpoint (which can be driver or server)
- all they need for configuration to communicate with the server is its host and
  port number

### selenium docs

- http://selenium.googlecode.com/git/docs/api/javascript/index.html (old docs)
- https://seleniumhq.github.io/docs/index.html (new docs)
- https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol

## "selenium-http" servers

- chromedriver
    - source code for it lives in the chromium source tree
    - a separate executable
    - functions as a sort of server process that takes care of launching and
      controlling the chrome processes you need
    - when run it listens on localhost:9515 and will respond to HTTP requests
      sent to that port
- firefox itself
    - I _think_ firefox can be run in such a way that it behaves as a selenium
      server
- a safari extension
- phantomjs
    - `phantomjs --webdriver=PORT` will run phantomjs as a selenium server
      (since 1.8+)
- the selenium java server
    - can be used as a proxy to pass on requests and responses to other servers
    - situations when you _need_ the java server
        1. the "selenium-server" is on a remote host
        2. you want to send commands to more than one browser at a time - this
           is why many testing frameworks require it

# approaches for testing the pack

- would be good to be as alike to our ember apps as possible
- how much setup would be required

- +1 selenium: no changes to index.html required. testem would require a
  test.html that loads the app + other stuff that would need to be updated
  whenever index.html is
- +1 testem: we can stop and debug a bit more easily. todo: figure out how to
  pause a selenium test and debug
- ?? which one makes multiple windows (e.g. facebook) easier to manage
- +1 selenium: having the tests run in node means I can use my facebook helpers
  stuff which only runs in node.
