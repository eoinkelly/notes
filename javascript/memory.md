# Memory and Javascript

An attempt to collect all my notes on this topic.

## Stack Vs. Heap

- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/79923/what-and-where-are-the-stack-and-heap

Stack

- Each thread gets a stack
- Stack is LIFO
- The size of the stack is set when the thread is created
- Used for function calls and parameters and return pointers

Heap

- In C stuff is put on the heap via new and malloc
- Can be very large
- Slower to allocate than the stack
- Used for objects

### Javascript Stack Size

- Varies by browser

Can test with

```js
var i = 0;
function inc() {
    i++;
    inc();
}
inc();
```

Some stats from:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7826992/browser-javascript-stack-size-limit

```
(number of iterations of a recursive function before we exceed stack size)

# Creating Memory Leaks in JS

- The DOM is the parsed representation of the HTML
- The DOM is declarative
- They tried to design the DOM to work with any language from C to JS to others
- JS is OO by convention only!

JS Objects

- Separate memory heap/Advanced GC
- Cycles are not a problem

DOM Objects

- C/C++ memory heap/ RefCounting: malloc() and free()
- Cycles are a problem for browser develoeprs

- We can create a memory leak by connecting JS objects and DOM objects

```js
// jsObject (a JS object) has a reference to document.body (a DOM object)
var jsObject = { element: document.body }j:j:;

// document.body (a DOM object) now has a reference to jsObject (the JS object
// which has a reference to a DOM object)
document.body.myAttribute = jsObject;
```

- You have now created a circular reference because you have stuff on the 2
  different heaps refering to each other
- Only a problem for long lived AJAX apps which don't reload pages

# Static memory JS talk

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op52liUjvSk

If you app uses X MB memory then you need 6X memory available for GC to be
comparable to manual memory management.

Memory pools can help with GC pressure.

# Memory analysis with Chrome

https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/memory-analysis-101

- Shallow size
    - the memory an object holds itself (the sum of the sizes of its immediate
      values)
    - Usually only String and Array have significant shallow sizes
    - Strings are often stored in renderer memory and only a small wrapper is
      exposed on the JS heap
- Immediate values
    - the values held directly in an object
- Retained size
    - shallow size + the memory held by other objects it references

- The heap
    - a graph (a network) of objects in memory
    - node = an object (labeled with the Constructor of it)
    - edte = a property
    - path = a sequence of edges
    - GC roots
        - ???
    - retaining path = any path from GC roots to a particular object
        - without a retaining path the object is eligible for collection
    - Dominator = a role that a node can play
        - A node is is a dominator if it exists in every simple path from the
          root to an object
        - If a dominator is removed all the objects it dominates can also be
          removed
        - Every object in the heap has exactly one dominator
        - This is making statements about the kind of tree the heap is
        - A dominator does not need to have a _direct_ reference to the objects
          it dominates
    - Accumulation point
        - An object (usually a collection) that retains a lot of memory
        - aka is a dominator for many objects

### Numbers

Numbers can be stored in two places

1. Immediate 31 bit integer values - so called "Small Integers" or SMIs
2. On the heap
    - if number cannot fit into the SMI form e.g. a double
    - if the number needs to be boxed e.g. to set properties. Presumably also if
      you call methods on it.

### Strings

Strings can be stored in two places:

1. Renderer memory
2. On the heap

- A string downloaded from the network (e.g. contents of a `<script>` tag) is
  not copied to the JS heap. It stays in the browser memory and a small wrapper
  object is created on the JS heap.
- V8 is lazy about concatenating strings. When you concatenate two strings their
  memory is not touched until absolutely necessary. Instead a "cons string"
  object is created that represents the concatenation. The concatenation really
  happens when you force it e.g. if you get a substring of the concatenated
  string.

### Objects

JS Object types:

1. Boolean
2. Number (double precision IEEE 754 float)
3. String (UTF-16 encode string)
4. Object (key value map)
    - key is _always_ a string (will be coerced into string if you give it
      something else)
    - value is any type of the 4 values

Objects have a "retaining tree" - the paths (1+) (node and edges) that prevent
the object from being freed.

Objects have 2 sizes

1. Shallow size
    - Just the object
    - Usually a small constant vlaue
    - size = self
2. Retained size
    - Sum of the shallow size of the object and all descendants
    - size = self + desendants

NB: Shallow === Retained for Boolean, Number, String

Garbage is defined as "all variables which cannot be referenced from the root
node.

Garbage colleciton is 2 phase

1. scan and find all garbarge
2. remove garbage and remove to system

Memory is split into "young" objects and "old" objects.

- When you call "new" you are pulling memory from the young memory pool.
- This is a cheap operation until ...
- If there is no available space in the young memory pool GC runs on it (and it
  alone) - this can take milliseconds

Things to be aware of

- How often am I allocating new objects?
- How long do I hold on to them?

e.g. in a game you pretty much need to be able to do a game with zero
allocations

- Objects (dictionaries) are backed by arrays in V8

- Arrays are the building blocks of JS objects

A typical JS object is made up of 2 arrays:

1. An array for named properties
2. An array for numeric elements

If the number of named properties is small then the array 1 will not be
created - the properties will be stored internally in the object.

A "map" describes object kind and its layout

An "native object group" is a collection of objects that hold mutual references
to each other.

Native objects are not represented in the heap - the have 0 size.

Instead wrapper objects are created. \* each wrapper holds a reference to the
corresponding native object and will send commands to/from it

## Javascript memory profiling

- https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-memory-profiling

A page with no JS \* Heap size is ~ 2.2 MB when page is first loaded rising to ~
2.9 MB in a few seconds

Ember-cli ember app (no content, just basic app created, application route
loaded) _ Production build heap size: ~ 12.2 MB _ Development: ~ 15 MB \*
Development + Ember inspector: ~ 15.5 MB

# Chrome dev tools

# Sources of memory leaks in the browser:

What causes memory leaks in the browser???

# Chrome dev tools heap snapshot view

Source:

- http://addyosmani.com/blog/taming-the-unicorn-easing-javascript-memory-profiling-in-devtools/

Uses:

- Find objects that are unreachable by JS but are not collected (and should be)

V8 does a GC just before it takes the snapshot NB: The heap snapshot does _not_
show scalar values - it only shows objects Q: does it count scalars toward the
sizes shown?

- (things)
    - Can ignore things in parenteses (I cannot control them)
- dimmed things Can ignore dimmed things (I cannot control them)

- @12345
    - an object unique ID
    - will be the same across heap snapshots so you can compare a particular
      object over time

- Red nodes
    - Red nodes do not have direct references from JavaScript to them, but are
      alive because they're part of a detached DOM tree.
    - There may be a node in the tree referenced from JavaScript (maybe as a
      closure or variable) but is coincidentally preventing the entire DOM tree
      from being garbage collected.

- Yellow nodes
    - Yellow nodes however do have direct references from JavaScript.
    - Look for yellow nodes in the same detached DOM tree to locate references
      from your JavaScript. There should be a chain of properties leading from
      the DOM window to the element (e.g window.foo.bar[2].baz).
