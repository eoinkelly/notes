Has a `Manager` instance which contains a number of `Recognizer` instances

The manager manages the given DOM element. it

1. sets up the "input event listeners"
2. sets the "touch action property" on the _element_

```js
mc.remove('rotate'); // remove a recognizer from the manager

mc.on('panleft', somefunc); // listen to the event generated by the recognizers
```

The recognizers generate events which we then listen to with `on` These events
are NOT DOM events by default
