# new Javascript(); // ES6

- evolutionary approach to the language
- `git checkout js-master && git merge coffeescript`
- rebranded ES2015, attempting move to "release train" ala Chrome

# Ways to get ES6 features

1. babel.js (transpiler, currently best feature support anywhere)
2. io.js (much more support than node, still not near babel.js)
3. node 0.12 (distant 3rd)

# Modules

- Node `require` is a runtime function not syntax.
    - Works great for node but other contexts need to treat it as _syntax_ e.g.
      browserify and friends
    - i.e. they cannot _evaluate_ it to figure out where to find the resource
- ES6 has module _syntax_
    - ES6 does not specify _how_ modules are found and loaded
- Syntax similar but slightly different to Node

# Final thoughts

- New features will start becoming available (and appearing in your codebase!)
- Worth adding a build step where previously there was none?
- Similar trade-offs to coffeescript for babel e.g. not exactly same source in
  debugger
- things that are syntax transforms vs things that need runtime polyfill
- babel = most "future living". node stable = most "present living"
- Worth developing some sort of opinion now about how much to take on
- farewell coffeescript?

# Modules

- Language-level support for modules for component definition.
- Codifies patterns from popular JavaScript module loaders (AMD, CommonJS).
- Runtime behaviour defined by a host-defined _default loader_.
- Implicitly async model â€“ no code executes until requested modules are
  available and processed.

- babel
    - will transpile to any of the usual module formats

# Babel

- top features
    - readable output
    - great docs including a REPL in page
    - will work on React.js code too
    - source maps
    - no runtime dependency (unless you want one)
    - browser support IE9+ (IE8 possible if you limit feature usage)

babel-node \* wrapper around node that will precompile any loaded .es6 modules

Loose mode aka "faster but less compliant" mode _ does not enable new
transformers _ tells some transformers to favour clean code over covering _all_
edge cases _ rationale _ these edge cases are unlikely to appear _ there is
significant overhead in supporting them _ code generated in loose mode will run
faster and be more readable \* can enable it on a transformer by transformer
basis

playground support _ for enabling "canary" transforms _ enabling playground
features also enables experimental \* the stuff in here hasn't even necessairly
made it to ECMA yet

experimental

"module formatter" \* a transformer that takes in ES6 module syntax and converts
it to other module syntax (common, amd, etc.)

## polyfill

babel includes a polyfill that includes

1. a custom regenerator runtime
    - created by facebook
    - https://github.com/facebook/regenerator
    - takes generator/yield syntax and turns it into runnable JS
    - there is a static transformer part and a runtime part
        - it is the runtime part included in this polyfill
2. core.js.
    - a "standard library" for JS
    - provides polyfills for all the various things that are built-in to modern
      JS

- The polyfill will emulate a full ES6 environment.
- This polyfill is automatically loaded when using babel-node and
  babel/register.
