# Service worker

Service worker code

- has no DOM access
- has a completely different lifecycle to the webpage
- may be stopped and started by the browser - if you need persistence between
  function calls you need to use localstorage or similar

Lifecycle of a SW

1. Register it
    - On the window.load event, you call
      `navifator.servicWorker.register('path/to/sw-code.js').then(function(registration) { })`
        - QUESTION: can it be done at documentReady ?

1. add event listeners for
    - install - fired once when the SW code is loaded by browser
        - also fired whenever a new version of the SW JS file is downloaded
    - fetch - fired every time the browser fetches a resource
    - waiting
    - activate - fired when the new version of the SW is about to take over from
      the old version

Statement: Other than the code which registers the SW, the rest of your app code
shouldn't know or care that the SW exists and is helping with caching. is this
true?
