    -   Aimed primarily for content sites
    - is a static site builder out of the box but you can add dapters to do SSR

      - astro can be a standalone server or a middleware for things like Express
    -   Does have SSR
    -   Uses file based routing (precompiles components into static HTML)
    -   Firmly a MPA approach - out of the box there is no client side rendering
        -   it seems like it's mostly precompiled into static HTML and CSS
        -   not sure how you add client side JS yet
    -   Netlify is their offical hosting partner
    -   > Astro is an MPA framework. Traditional MPA frameworks also include

    -   can pull data from many CMSes and sources
    -   serves 0 js to the client by default
        -   it builds static pages by default I think. you have to explicitly enable SSR via an adapter for your platform
