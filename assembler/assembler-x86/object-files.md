# Object files

- contain
    1. a _relocatable_ machine instruction stream
    2. metadata
        - relocation ino
        - stack unwinding info
        - comments
        - program symbols
        - debugging and profiling info
        - info to resolve symbolic cross references between modules
- are divided up into sections called "segments"
- many segments map directly to memory segments of a process in RAM so they have
  the same names
- example segments
    1. header
    2. code segment (aka text segment)
        - the instruction stream
    3. Data segment
        - initialized static variables
    4. Read-only data segment
        - initialized static constants
    5. BSS segment
        - uninitialized static constants and variables
    6. External definitions and references for linking
    7. Relocation information
    8. Dynamic linking info
    9. Debugging info
        - can be part of the object file format e.g. COFF or an embedded other
          format e.g. DWARF
- examples of formats
    - COFF (Windows)
    - ELF (linux)
    - Mach-O (Mac)

# looking at an object file created by yasm
$ file first.o
first.o: ELF 64-bit LSB  relocatable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), not stripped
```

from inspection of an ELF object file:

- instruction stream seems to begin after 64 bytes of some header stuff
