# Book: Introduction to 64 bit Assembly Language Programming for Linux

## Introduction

Terminology

- Assembler vs Assembly
    - assembly is to assembler as c is to gcc
    - Assembly is the language you put in the text file. An assembler turns that
      into an object file
- macro assembler
    - a tool that allows paramaterized assembly language text can be represented
      by a name and the expanded version inserted into the code
    - most modern assemblers have preprocessors e.g `yasm` has a selection of
      them: nasm, tasm, raw, cpp, gas
    - ASSUMPTION: they function similarly to the C preprocessor.
        - the `cpp` preprocessor for `yasm` actually uses a C preprocessor
- high-level assembler
    - provides things like if/else, loops etc.
- cross assembler
    - allows you to build object files for platform X on platform Y
- micro assembler
    - builds firmware
- meta assembler
    - a program that given a description of an assembly language can generate
      and assembler for it

ASIDE: The attitude of assembly language programmers is that they do it because
they must but want to keep as many nice things as they would have if they used
something like C ("nice things" is relative!)

### Significant features of 64 bit architecture

- In 64 bit architecture segment registers are "essentially obsolete" because of
  the extra register size.
- more register usage is general purpose
    - except "repeat-string" loops which use specific registers and have no
      operands
- 16 general purpose registers
- 16 floating point registers

Pages in memory begin with addresses that the 3 right most bits are 0

    0x???? ???? ???? ?000

### Evolution of programming languages

- 1st gen language: Machine language
    - enter all intructions and bytes as hex data
    - you have to manually calculate and know the addresses of your data
    - the destination addresses of your JMPs will change as you add/delete
      source code so all those calculations would change every time. Bummer.
        - I wonder what features of modern computer architecture are a result of
          that constraint? e.g. starting stack at top and growing down?
- 2nd gen language: Assembly languages
    - lets you use symbols to refer to memory addresses so you don't have to
      change everything when you add some data.
- 3rd gen language: Cobol & Fortran

### Why bother with assembler?

- all variable access is pointer access - safety schmafety.
- writing assembly is approx 2x as slow even for experts
- great way to learn about computer constraints

## Chapter 1

- the language is called "symbolic" assembly because symbols are used to
  represent
    - points in the instruction stream (labels)
    - names of registers
    - locations in memory
    - instruction codes e.g. mov, int etc. are symbols which represent a bit
      sequence which is the instruction
        - aka "symbolic opcodes"
        - the same memonic e.g. `mov` can be used to generate different
          instructions (op codes) depending on context
    - instructions to the assembler itself aka
        - assembler direcives
        - pseudo-opcodes or pseudo-ops
- start at the `_start` label:
    - on linux the `_start` label is what the system will transfer control to
      when it loads the executable
    - `_start` calls the C main function if you wrote you executable in C
- making system calls
    - 32bit asm had `int 0x80`
    - x64 added a dedicated (and faster) `syscall` instruction
    - they do NOT use the same sys call numbers!
    - numbers for int 0x80:
      <http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/arch/x86/include/asm/unistd_32.h?v=3.0>
    - numbers for syscall:
      <http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/arch/x86/include/asm/unistd_64.h?v=3.0>
- A 64-bit system call is
    1.  load the system call number into `rax`
    1.  load the params you want to pass into `rdi, rsi, rdx, r10, r8, r9` (in
        that order)
    1.  send the `syscall` opcode to the CPU
    1.  CPU switches to kernel mode and the kernel does its thing
    1.  Gather return value in `rax`
        - be careful to note that `rcx` and `r11` may have changed during the
          system call
- So every system call is essentially loading 1-7 values into registers and
  giving up control to the kernel
- Parameters are passed in the order they appear in the function signature of
  the corresponding C wrapper function.
- You may find syscall functions and their signatures in every Linux API
  documentation

Instructions are one of

1. machine instructions
    - exaples: `mov`, `leq` etc.
2. macros
    - examples: ???
3. instructions to the assembler
    - called a "pseudo opcode" or "assembler directive"
    - examples
        - `segment .<segment-name>`
        - `globl <symbol-name>` (note spelling)
            - tells the assembler to make the given symbol visible to the
              linker.

Exercises

- when I built the same trivial program using `main` instead of `_start` and
  using gcc as the linker the binary size went from 1.4K to 8.9K

- Why does shell if statement consider 0 truthy, non-zero falsy
    - In C: 0 = false, non-zero = true
    - Shell if statements: 0 = true, non-zero = false
    - System calls generally return 0 on success so the shell wants to be able
      to test for the success of a program, hence the shell `if` treats 0 as
      truthy.

- Why do system calls return 0 on success?
    - possible answers
        - 0 is the most cross platform number - you don't have to care about
          endianness
            - it allows the following coding pattern
                ```c
                error = do_some_syscall(...);
                if (error) {
                    // handle error
                }
                // otherwise onwards and upwards
                ```

## Chapter 2

- yasm represents hex numbers using `0x` prefix

- representing negative integers
    - only applies to signed integers
    - if we just used high-order bit as a sign bit it would work but we would
      need different circuitry to add a positive and negative number and get the
      correct value
    - we needed a way to represent negative number so they could be
      added/subtracted/multiplied/divided with positive numbers using the same
      circuitry as when you have two positive numbers
    - enter _two's compliment_
- to get two's complement representation of a positive intger X
    1. represent the absolute value in binary (ignore sign)
    1. invert all the bits
    1. add 1 to the number

### Floating point representation in 64 bit architectures

- 64 bit architecture supports 3 kinds of floating point number
    - float = 32 bits
    - double = 64 bits
    - long double = 80 bits
- the format of each of the above is the same just with different field lengths

- NOTE: Floating point representation is a sort of "storage format" for a number
    - floats are converted to a standard binary representation before being
      operated on and the results converted back afterwards

- WARNING: in .lst files you will see hex representations of numbers defined in
  your assembly but the _byte_ (not bit) order is reversed
    - The CPU stores the least significant byte first

```
; example .lst file snippet
; notice that the bytes are flipped from how we would expect

     5 00000000 00000000               zero dd 0
     6 00000004 01000000               one dd 1
```

- to do algebraic operation on two floats:
    1. convert them into raw binary numbers
    2. perform the operation
    3. convert result back to float

## Chapter 3: Computer memory

### How processor converts logical address to real physical address

```
logical-address = page-number + offset-within-page # note page *number* not page *address*

# the mapping (aided by harware registers)
page-number -> physical offset in RAM # note offset-within-page is not mapped
```

- x86-64 CPUs have "hardware mapping registers" which can map different page
  sizes (depending on CPU):
    - 4 KB (used by linux kernel for most things)
        - right-most 12 bits is offset within page
    - 2 MB (used by linux for kernel)
        - right-most 21 bits is offset within page
    - 1 GB (only in recent CPUs)
        - right-most 30 bits is offset within page
- NOTE: only the _page number_ is mapped, not the offset within the page
- The OS has special instructions for managing the hardware mapping registers
- Take example of a 4 KB page at logical address `0x40_0000_2220`
    1. interpret the logical address
        - we need 4096 "offsets" so the right-most 12 bits is the offset `0x220`
        - the rest of the bits are the logical "page number" `0x40_0000_2`
    2. ask the hardware mapping registers to convert the logical page number
       into a physical page offset

- On linux the logical address (including both page number and offset) is 48
  bits long (see aside below for why)

```
0x0000 0040 0000 [code segment starts here(ish), is fixed size] # lowest address (TODO: why doesn't it start at 0x0)

[data segment starts above code, is fixed size]

[bss segment starts above data segment, is fixed size]

[heap segment starts here, grows upwards]

0x7FFF FFFF FFFF [stack starts here(ish), grows downwards] # highest address (47 bits all 1's), 131 TB
```

- Note: the heap is surprisingly not a heap data structure
- Some linux systems use somewhat random stack, data, heap start addresses for
  security reasons
    - i.e. the locations will change with each execution of a program
- Files can be memory mapped into the heap so it may be that data and
  instructions are read from the heap in this case

#### Aside: why does process begin at 0x400000 (exactly 4 MB)?

- Good answer for why it does on windows:
  <https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20141003-00/?p=43923/>
    - they do it to make context switching between windows 3.1 and win95 fast
      and still do it for legacy reasons
- but why does linux do it?
- it seems the decision is made by the linker
- it seems to be a convention rather than a rule - you can change it with a
  custom linker script
- the explanation below makes sense but if page size is 4KB why is 4MB set
  aside?

### Aside: Why are logical addresses only 48 bits not 64

> From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64
>
> Although virtual addresses are 64 bits wide in 64-bit mode, current
> implementations (and all chips known to be in the planning stages) do not
> allow the entire virtual address space of 264 bytes (16 EB) to be used. This
> would be approximately four billion times the size of virtual address space on
> 32-bit machines. Most operating systems and applications will not need such a
> large address space for the foreseeable future, so implementing such wide
> virtual addresses would simply increase the complexity and cost of address
> translation with no real benefit. AMD therefore decided that, in the first
> implementations of the architecture, only the least significant 48 bits of a
> virtual address would actually be used in address translation (page table
> lookup).[1](p120)
>
> In addition, the AMD specification requires that bits 48 through 63 of any
> virtual address must be copies of bit 47 (in a manner akin to sign extension),
> or the processor will raise an exception.[1](p131) Addresses complying with
> this rule are referred to as "canonical form."[1](p130) Canonical form
> addresses run from 0 through 00007FFF'FFFFFFFF, and from FFFF8000'00000000
> through FFFFFFFF'FFFFFFFF, for a total of 256 TB of usable virtual address
> space. This is still approximately 64,000 times the virtual address space on
> 32-bit machines.
>
> This feature eases later scalability to true 64-bit addressing. Many operating
> systems (including, but not limited to, the Windows NT family) take the
> higher-addressed half of the address space (named kernel space) for themselves
> and leave the lower-addressed half (user space) for application code, user
> mode stacks, heaps, and other data regions.[20] The "canonical address" design
> ensures that every AMD64 compliant implementation has, in effect, two memory
> halves: the lower half starts at 00000000'00000000 and "grows upwards" as more
> virtual address bits become available, while the higher half is "docked" to
> the top of the address space and grows downwards. Also, enforcing the
> "canonical form" of addresses by checking the unused address bits prevents
> their use by the operating system in tagged pointers as flags, privilege
> markers, etc., as such use could become problematic when the architecture is
> extended to implement more virtual address bits.

# Linux memory areas

Memory is divided into 4 areas

1. Stack
    - always mapped to the highest address of a process
        - highest valid stack address: `0x7fff_ffff_ffff` (131 TB)
        - lowest valid stack address: `0x7fff_ff00_0000` (stack grows down)
        - Based on the 48 bit logical addresses
        - restricted to 16MB by the kernel
            - => stack space is a constrained resource
        - the stack will automatically grow when needed by the OS responding to
          a page fault.
1. Heap
    - the heap is not implemented with a "Heap" data structure!
    - a dynanically allocoated chunk of memory
    - can grow as much as physical memory and swap will allow
1. Data
    - placed right above the text segment
    - contains both
        - .data
            - data statically allocated _and_ initialized by the compiler
        - .bss
            - data statically allocated by the process but not stored in the
              executable
            - initialized to all `0` when process is launched
1. Text
    - the instruction stream lives here
    - the lowest address is `0x0000_0040_0000`

## Inspecting a process address space on mac

    vmmap <PID>

## Inspecting a process address space on linux

```
cat /proc/<PID>/maps

# $$ = current process
cat /proc/$$/maps
```

Columns in /proc/PID/maps output:

- start_address
- end_address
- permissions
    - r = read
    - w = write
    - x = execute
    - p = private, s = shared
- offset
    - if the region was mapped from a file this is the offset in the file that
      mapping begins
    - is 0 if region was not mapped from file
- device
    - major:minor device number if the region was mapped from file
- inode
    - inode number of file if region was mapped from file
- pathname
    - full path to the file if the region was mapped from file
    - special "paths"
    - `[heap]`
    - `[stack]`
    - `[vsyscall]`
    - `[vdso]`
        - virtual dynamic shared object
        - used by system calls to switch to kernel mode

## Address Space Layout Randomization ASLR

Address space layout randomization ASLR is a process of using a _somewhat_
random stack, data, heap start addresses.

- makes buffer overflow and stack overflow attacks harder
- linux has it since 2005
- OS X since Lion
- iOS, Android, FreeBSD also have it
- Windows has it since vista and had a good one since Windows 8

```
# can disable address space randomisation via:
sudo sh -c 'echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space'
```

## Op-codes for reserving data in the `.data` section

- db = reserve and initialize byte (8 bits)
- dw = reserve and initialize word (16 bits)
- dd = reserve and initialize double word (32 bits)
- dq = reserve and initialize quad word (64 bits)

```asm
section .data
    ; <var-name> <op-code> <value>
    a dd 4              ; create a 4 byte int
    b dd 4.4            ; create a 4 byte float
    c dw 1, 2, 3        ; create an array of 3 elements
    d db 0xfe           ; create a byte
    e db "hello", 0     ; create a byte array & intialize with a string. Note the explicit null termination

    ; there is a shortcut for bulk initialization
    ;<var-name> times <multiplier> <reservation-opcode> <initial-value>
    c times 10 dd 0
```

## Op-codes for reserving space in the `bss` section

- resb = reserve byte
- resw = reserve word (16 bits)
- resd = reserve double word (32 bits)
- resq = reserve quad word (64 bits)

```asm
section .bss
    ;<var-name> <op-code> <multipler>
    a resd 1    ; reserve 1 double-word (4 byte) area
    b resw 10   ; reserver 10 * 16bit areas
    c resb 100  ; reserve 100 single byte areas
```

# Aside: How C stores arrays

This C file

```c
// array_test.c
#include <stdio.h>

char everywhere[3] = {'a', 'b', 'c'};

int main() {
    int arr[3] = {1, 2, 3};
