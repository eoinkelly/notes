# List files

From yasm manual

From `nasm` manual

> Causes an assembly listing to be directed to the given file, in which the

- shows assembly source on right beside the generated code on the left
- listing files are generated by the assembler
- seem to be designed for human consumption for debugging
- multiple formats are available but yasm only supports _nasm style_ format by
  default.

# nasm list file format

- first line is unusual
    ```
        1                                 %line 1+1 first.s
    ```
- a .lst file will contain the instructions from many files - I presume the
  first line is some sort of header identifying which file the following
  instructions come from
- it reads like the original .s file with comments removed except all lines are
  moved down by one
- assembler directives are wrapped in []

Instruction Line format:

```
{line number} {instruction offset} {instruction op code} {symbolic instruction as per assembly source}
```

- instruction offset
    - 6 hex digits
    - offset of the instruction in the instruction stream
    - this is my guess from inspection, have not confirmed anywhere
- instruction op code
    - 0-14 hex digits or `<gap>`
    - hex representing the actual instruction in the stream
    - this is my guess from inspection, have not confirmed anywhere

## Aside: endianness

- refers to _byte_ order not _bit_ order
- is lifted from Gullivers travels
- big endian: most significant byte stored first
    - network protocols generally transmit bytes big endian
    - also called "network byte order"
    - the way we write down decimal numbers is big endian (we write most
      significant digit first)
- little endian: least significant byte stored first
    - x86 processors (chosen in '60's, no particularly good reasons for it)
- some ARM processors can switch endianness for different instructions:w

# CPU stores number least significant byte first

- WARNING: in .lst files you will see hex representations of numbers defined in
  your assembly but the _byte_ (not bit) order is reversed
    - The CPU stores the least significant byte first

```
; example .lst file snippet
; notice that the bytes are flipped from how we would expect

     5 00000000 00000000               zero dd 0
     6 00000004 01000000               one dd 1
```
