### The main bits of logging infrastructure:

1. journald
2. rsyslogd
3. awslog

- `journald` is configured to send all its logs to syslog by default
    - see `#ForwardToSyslog=yes` in `/etc/systemd/journald.conf`

- journald gets logs from:
    - Kernel log messages, via kmsg
    - Simple system log messages, via the libc syslog(3) call
    - Structured system log messages via the native Journal API, see
      sd_journal_print(4)
    - Standard output and standard error of system services
    - Audit records, via the audit subsystem

### Sources of messages

- Kernel messages
    - logged to `/proc/kmsg` aka the "kernel ring buffer"
    - `dmesg` is a program that dumps /proc/kmsg. In addition, it provides some
      filtering capabilities to weed out logs that the user isn't interested in.
    - also sent to `/var/log/kern.log`
- `syslog(3)` libc function
- `sd_journal_print(4)` libc function
    - sends direclty to journald
- anythign else which rsyslogd is configured to pull in

### Important log files

- /var/log/auth.log
    - auth related messages
- /var/log/syslog
    - general messages execpt auth
- /var/log/mail.log
    - mail related messages
    - doesn't exist by default on AWS Ubuntu (probalby because we don't install
      an MTA)
- /var/log/cloud-init.log
-     * seems to be an AWS thing
- /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
    - seems to be the output of the AWS script which sets up the instance
    - our user-data script output is visible in it until our script redirects
      its output
- /var/log/messages
    - doesn't exist in modern Ubuntu (it sends everything to `/var/log/syslog`)
