Goma Wakame Recipes 


Seaweed Salad (Nori)

10 grams aka-tosaka-nori seaweed
10 grams ao-tosaka-nori seaweed
10 grams ao-ogo-nori seaweed
10 grams wakame seaweed

4 tablespoons white sesame seeds
4 tablespoons vinegar
4 tablespoons dashi stock 
3 tablespoons sweet light miso
sugar

For salted seaweed, soak in cold water for 20 - 30 minutes to
dliminate saltiness and drain. Cut into bite-sized pieces.

Make sesame-vinegar-miso. Roast white sesame seeds and grind well
in suribachi (Japanese grinding bowl). Add sweet light miso and
grind more. Marinate in vinegar, sugar and dashi stock.

Arrange seaweed colorfully. At the center of the plate, put
sesame-vinegar-miso.

Variations: Besides seaweed, carrot, cucumber and celery are good
ingredients for this salad. Shallots and wine-vinegar also make a
delicious dressing. Heat minced shallot with salad oil and add
wine-vinegar.

Wakame Seaweed Salad With Gomasio 

Seaweed is great in salads. 

What You Will Need
2 ounces fresh wakame seaweed
2 Japanese cucumbers
assorted young greens (mesclun)
1 tablespoon su rice vinegar
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon sesame oil
3 tablespoons grapeseed or other neutral oil
pinch salt
pinch fresh white pepper
prepared Chinese mustard 

What Now?
Pour hot water over fresh wakame seaweed. Immerse in water and drain. Cut into 1 inch lengths. 

Wash the cucumbers then take a fork and run it along the skin from tip to tip on one side and then the other to score it to make a simple pattern. Japanese cucumbers are much more delicate than Western varities. If you cannot find them, use a single English cucumber, slice it in half and seed it. Cut on the bias into thin rounds and sprinkle with salt. 

Tear the baby greens into bite-sized pieces and arrange in a bowl. 

Mix and stir the dressing ingredients. 

Mix seaweed, cucumbers with the dressing and then place them ontop of the greens. Garnish with gomasio (sesame salt). 
		

Sea vegetables have become familiar to many Americans over the last few decades, thanks to the increased availability and popularity of Asian foods. Wakame salad with sesame seeds ("goma wakame") is not a fast food recipe, but it's fun to make and enthusiastically appreciated by those to whom it is offered. (Hint: make a lot). Although this recipe calls for 1-1/2 ounces of dried wakame, I usually just measure it roughly by the handful; the exact amount isn't important.

1-1/2 ounces dried wakame sea vegetable (about 3 handfuls)
2 sweet red peppers, sliced into thin strips
2 or 3 tablespoons fresh cilantro, chopped
2 tablespoons fresh ginger root, sliced very fine
1 tablespoon maple syrup
1/3 cup rice vinegar
1 tablespoon tamari sauce
1/2 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 small red hot chile peppers, sliced into fine strips (optional)
4 tablespoons freshly toasted sesame seeds


Rinse the wakame in cool water and place in a stainless steel bowl. Cover with fresh water and allow to rehydrate for about 5 minutes. Drain wakame and squeeze out excess water with your hands. Slice wakame on a clean wooden cutting board into very thin strips with a sharpened vegetable knife. (The thick central stems of the wakame can be reserved for later use in vegetable soup or stew). Place wakame, sweet pepper slices, and chopped cilantro in a bowl.

In a separate bowl, combine all remaining ingredients except the sesame seeds. Pour dressing over the wakame mixture and toss well. Taste and adjust seasoning. The salad will keep well for a day or so in the fridge. Just before serving, sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds. (See previous post for toasted sesame seed recipe).

Note: If you don't have sweet red peppers, try using cucumbers or carrots, thinly sliced, instead.
