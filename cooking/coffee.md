# Coffee

## My recipe

-   chemex
-   water volume: 250ml
-   coffee volume: 60g/l ground coffee to net water (excluding water absorbed by coffee)
    -   15g/250ml
-   grind TODO
    -   should resemble sea salt, slightly finer than for a french press
    -   wait for 2nd pour to completely go through before starting subsequent pours
-   steep time: TODO
-   pour technique: TODO
-   water temp: TODO
    -   i have a temp probe - i can decant kettle into another vessel or measure how long kettle
        takes to cool to right range
-   milk volume: TODO
-   brew time: TODO

```
# WIP technique notes

Observe the flow rate in the chemex - what am I aiming for?

- brewing time should be around 3:30 to 4:30, if it takes longer the coffee can taste bitter, means: grind coarser,
remember brewtime will be different for different sizes of chemex

if the brewtime is shorter: grind finer

 use 54 grs/ ml of water for a hot bloom, give the chemex a little shake to get all grounds wet and wait 30-45 secs
- slowly add 60% of your water and wait 30 secs
- add the other 40% of your leftover water
- while the coffee is dripping through the filter, you can give your chemex another little shake to get all grounds in the brewing process
```

## Next steps

Immediate

-   Consider filtered water
-   Use a courser grind
-   Figure out my coffee:water ratio
-   Play with colder water to get smoother/weaker brew
-   compare plunger and Chemex with same grind and beans

Future

-   Consider fancy kettle that can hit exact temp, keep water at a temp and has a goose neck spout
-   try fancy water

## Buying, storing, keeping

-   Beans in freezer
-   Beans best 7-30 days after roasting (freezing extends freshness but not sure how much)

## Water

### Temp

-   TL;DR: Water temp doesn't matter unless you are brewing very dark roasts
-   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikt-X5x7yoc
-   Hotter water does brew faster because more energy available to speed up chemical reactions but
    this is probably negligible
-   Brewing from a normal kettle of just boiled water gets the coffee slurry to about 92degC so it's
    fine to do this for medium and light roasts. For darker roasts you might get better results by
    brewing with cooler water in the 80-90 degC range

### Purity

TODO

## Ratios

-   grams/litre is good way to express ratios
-   hoffman likes
    -   60g/l as a baseline for pour-over and espresso - that's 15g/250ml (approx 17:1)
    -   70-75g/l as a baseline for french press and other immersion techniques (this is approx
        14:1 - 15:1)
        -   that is 17.5g/250ml (70g/l / 4)
-   recommended ratios in online tutorials are between (immersion) 13:1 - 16:1 (pour over, espresso)

## Extraction

-   ~33% of ground coffee is not soluble (it's wood, fibre etc.)
-   ~66% of ground coffee is soluble, roughly speaking you want 20% of that 66% for good taste.
    -   So 60g ground coffee = 12g extracted soluble matter

## Grinding

-   Use kosher salt course grind for immersion methods (e.g. french press) and chemex
    -   course grind gives you faster flow rate
-   Some people report needing to grind decaf finer than regular to get the same result

## Chemex

Chemex filters strip away more oils giving a cleaner cup.

### Recipe

1. Grind
    - Kosher salt size - quite course
1. Fold paper with the thick folds over the spout
1. Pre-rinse the paper in the chemex before brewing (also heats up the chemex). Discard the water
1. Pour in ground coffee.
    - Option 1: Make a divet so the water has an even depth of coffee to go through at all places
    - Option 2: some recipes say the coffee bed flat
1. 2 pours, a lot of moving around in the pour to agitate
    1. Pour #1: the bloom pour
        - 100g or 30sec
        - coffee should bubble and be "excited"
        - no bloom means coffee is probably stale
    2. Pour #2: Second pour
        - the rest of your water
        - pour in spirals
        - control the flow rate
        - you should still have a flat coffee bed at the end - this means you poured well
1. Total brew time should be 4min ish

## Hario V60 recipe

-   Use a slightly finer grind than chemex

## My gaps

-   I'm not sure I can pick stale beans in taste

## Finding a good recipe

-   Hoffman recommends change extraction (grind size, steep length, agitate more) before messing
    with ratio.
-   Get a drink you like before you mess with ratio.
-   He recommends using more coffee for infusion methods over percolation methods (maybe 70-75g per
    litre) Pour-over coffee absorbs 2g water per 1g ground coffee.

that water never makes it out of the coffee bed so it's not in your cup. Eg. 30g coffee bed will
absorb 60g water infusion methods don't lose that water so they end up weaker for the same amount of
coffee hoffman recommends: 60g/l for pour-over, 75g/l for infusion

    - => if you have a bed of 30g of coffee it will absorb 60g of water

## Decaf specific

-   Buying
    -   buy decaf from a roaster that cares a lot about their decaf
-   Stales quicker
    -   Decaf is more porous so oxygen gets into the coffee much more easily than caff coffee (for
        similar roast levels - darker roasts always stale quicker)
    -   Decaf ages quickly so keep in freezer. a dark roast decaf will stale up to 2 weeks after
        roast if not stored in airtight container (darker roasts stale quicker)
    -   Some people report that they have to grind decaf finer than regular coffee for the same
        result
-   Grinding
    -   Decaf grinds mostly the same as normal coffee for similar roasts (diff roasts do grind
        differently)
    -   Decaf whole beans often looks more roasted than it actually is (decaf process makes it more
        porous) but the ground version can look quite a bit lighter.

## Tasting

See [Prufrock Coffee Tasting Guide.pdf](./Prufrock%20Coffee%20Tasting%20Guide.pdf)

How to think about rating coffee:

1.  Acidity
    -   perceived around the sides of tongue
    -   can be felt on a scale from negative (harsh sour) or positive (bright, crisp, fresh)
    -   sometimes people confuse bitter and sour
2.  Sweetness
    -   coffee is not sweet in a table sugar kind of way
    -   it's a kind of composite - acidity can add to it, texture can add to it
    -   some coffees are sweeter than others but don't go looking for sugar sweet
    -   you can really only figure it out by comparing multiple coffees
3.  Body
    -   texture, mouth feel
    -   think difference between full milk and skim milk
    -   Robusta has a lot of body/texture but not everyone enjoys it
    -   you need to use cupping to compare mouth feel - paper filters homogenise it
4.  Finish
    -   What are you left with?
    -   Are you left with anything? Some coffees disappear
    -   What flavours develop over time?
    -   Do you like the flavours which develop?
5.  Flavour
    -   subtle flavours
    -   you don't have to use flowery very precise descriptors
    -   Don't be too specific but do note the words that pop into your brain
    -   precise descriptors might not be replicable if you don't have same water, brewing technique
    -   Fruit descriptors (useful if you want to categorise acidity)
        1. Stone fruits: berry, plum, peach
        2. Cooked fruits: pies
            - Sometimes in lower acidity coffee
        3. Tropical - fermented fruit flavours
            - Strawberries (oddly), mango, pineapple
            - People either love/hate coffees which have these flavours
    -   Maillard (browning) descriptors)
        -   Caramel
        -   Chocolate
        -   Maple syrup
        -   Baked good

Negative flavour words

-   Bitter
-   Earth/soil
-   Wood
-   Mushrooms
-   Rubber
-   Burnt

Speciality coffee considers bitterness a failure but there is undeniably bitter flavours in coffee.
They just won't mention it.

:question: what is 2nd wave and 3rd wave coffee?

:question: Robusta and types of coffee

## Grinding to target flavour

-   err on the side of coarse
-   start coarse and then tweak to finer
-   try fixing bitter coffee by grinding coarser, brewing shorter, and using top quality water
    first.

> If you are too coarse, you get under extraction and over the top acidity. Every step finer will
> improve this.
>
> Going too fine means channeling and uneven flow. This also means under extraction!! So the overall
> bed is under extracted but the channels will be over extracted which leads to astringency!
>
> So you get under extracted (acidity) and over extracted flavours (astringency)
>
> It's impossible to say how changing the grind size in either direction will affect the brew This
> is why you should not start fine
