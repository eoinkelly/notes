S01E08 Gravy • gravy is a colloid (clouds lava lamp, mayonaise) ◦ colloid = any
liquid or gas which has another substance dispersed throughout it in particle
form • root starches, clear hot or cold, freeze well (potato starch, arrow root,
tapiocha) • thicken gravy with lowest protien flour you can ◦ protien will cook
and rise to the top • how does thickening work? ◦ starch granules burst when
exposed to heat ◦ they release long chains of glucose ◦ if there are enough of
these chains they tangle up and trap the liquid they are in (which thickens the
sauce) • which flour is best for gravy? ◦ soft/pastry/cake flour is best because
it is low protien ◦ any kind of flour will do • avoiding lumps ◦ if you put the
flour in all at once, it forms big lumps, the outside of which gelatinises when
it hits the hot liquid - this creates a gooey barrier which prevents the flour
at the center of the lump from coming into contact with the liquid ◦ => the
ideal way to add flour to the liquid is as separate granules! THis is hard to
do! • 3 ways to add flour to hot liquid without lumps ◦ 1. create a slurry ▪
mix flour + cold liquid (water, stock, wine) together to make slurry ▪ stir the
slurry into the hot liquid over low heat until thickened ▪ - they need ~1hr of
simmering to cook the raw taste out of the flour ▪ - AB thinks the resulting
sauce isn't  as stable as roux ◦ 2. make a paste (beurre manie) ▪ knead equal
parts soft butter and flour into a paste ▪ whisk into the base (hot) liquid and
stir over low heat until thickened ▪ - they need ~1hr of simmering to cook the
raw taste out of the flour ▪ - AB thinks this method is not as stable as roux
(stable = ???) ◦ 3. create a roux ▪ equal parts fat & flour (by weight) cooked
together before being added to the liquid ▪ cooking the flour in the butter
coats each starch grain in a layer of fat, stopping them from sticking together
▪ melt the butter ▪ add the flour all at once and start whisking immediately
▪ after a few mins the roux will thin out for a while ▪ after this point we
are starting to cook the flour ▪ after 5 mins = white roux ▪ light roux ▪
blonde roux ▪ brick roux = ? mins, 25% thickening ability of white roux ▪ can
be made in oven, put in ther uncovered at 180 C for at least 1 hr (occasional
stirring) ▪ you can use the fat from the meat instead of/in addition to butter
▪ the roux and the liquid to be thickened should be at opposing temperatures
(the roux should be cool, the stock should be hot) ▪ flour starts thickening
things at aroudn 65C (well below simmering point) - this means that if you keep
stirring, by the time you see bubbles break the surface you are fully thickened
▪ for the best outcome, cook the sauce over a simmer for 30 mins plus - this
will make for a smoother sauce as fats & protiens float to the top ▪ sauces
thickened by flour thicken more as they cool! - this is called “tightening" =>
it should leave the pan a little thinner than you want it to be ▪ 1 oz flour +
1 oz fat can thicken 1 cup liquid • tools for sauces ◦ saucier pan ▪ rounded at
bottom: imitates many pan sizes if you don’t have much liquid, easy whisk access
▪ a whisk with a lot of loops - breaks the flour up better giving a smoother
sauce • gravy should be thick enough to cling to food without weighing it down •
you should err on the side of making the gravy too thick as it is much easier to
thin than to thicken • gravy made with milk is called ‘bechamel’ - one of the 5
“mother” sauces of french cooking
