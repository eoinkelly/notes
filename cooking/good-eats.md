S01E08 Gravy
    •   gravy is a colloid (clouds lava lamp, mayonaise)
    ◦   colloid = any liquid or gas which has another substance dispersed throughout it in particle form
    •   root starches, clear hot or cold, freeze well (potato starch, arrow root, tapiocha)
    •   thicken gravy with lowest protien flour you can
    ◦   protien will cook and rise to the top
    •   how does thickening work?
    ◦   starch granules burst when exposed to heat
    ◦   they release long chains of glucose
    ◦   if there are enough of these chains they tangle up and trap the liquid they are in (which thickens the sauce)
    •   which flour is best for gravy?
    ◦   soft/pastry/cake flour is best because it is low protien
    ◦   any kind of flour will do
    •   avoiding lumps
    ◦   if you put the flour in all at once, it forms big lumps, the outside of which gelatinises when it hits the hot liquid - this creates a gooey barrier which prevents the flour at the center of the lump from coming into contact with the liquid
    ◦   => the ideal way to add flour to the liquid is as separate granules! THis is hard to do!
    •   3 ways to add flour to hot liquid without lumps
    ◦   1. create a slurry
    ▪   mix flour + cold liquid (water, stock, wine) together to make slurry
    ▪   stir the slurry into the hot liquid over low heat until thickened
    ▪   - they need ~1hr of simmering to cook the raw taste out of the flour
    ▪   - AB thinks the resulting sauce isn't  as stable as roux
    ◦   2. make a paste (beurre manie)
    ▪   knead equal parts soft butter and flour into a paste
    ▪   whisk into the base (hot) liquid and stir over low heat until thickened
    ▪   - they need ~1hr of simmering to cook the raw taste out of the flour
    ▪   - AB thinks this method is not as stable as roux (stable = ???)
    ◦   3. create a roux
    ▪   equal parts fat & flour (by weight) cooked together before being added to the liquid
    ▪   cooking the flour in the butter coats each starch grain in a layer of fat, stopping them from sticking together
    ▪   melt the butter
    ▪   add the flour all at once and start whisking immediately
    ▪   after a few mins the roux will thin out for a while
    ▪   after this point we are starting to cook the flour
    ▪   after 5 mins = white roux
    ▪   light roux
    ▪   blonde roux
    ▪   brick roux = ? mins, 25% thickening ability of white roux
    ▪   can be made in oven, put in ther uncovered at 180 C for at least 1 hr (occasional stirring)
    ▪   you can use the fat from the meat instead of/in addition to butter
    ▪   the roux and the liquid to be thickened should be at opposing temperatures (the roux should be cool, the stock should be hot)
    ▪   flour starts thickening things at aroudn 65C (well below simmering point) - this means that if you keep stirring, by the time you see bubbles break the surface you are fully thickened
    ▪   for the best outcome, cook the sauce over a simmer for 30 mins plus - this will make for a smoother sauce as fats & protiens float to the top
    ▪   sauces thickened by flour thicken more as they cool! - this is called “tightening" => it should leave the pan a little thinner than you want it to be
    ▪   1 oz flour + 1 oz fat can thicken 1 cup liquid
    •   tools for sauces
    ◦   saucier pan
    ▪   rounded at bottom: imitates many pan sizes if you don’t have much liquid, easy whisk access
    ▪   a whisk with a lot of loops - breaks the flour up better giving a smoother sauce
    •   gravy should be thick enough to cling to food without weighing it down
    •   you should err on the side of making the gravy too thick as it is much easier to thin than to thicken
    •   gravy made with milk is called ‘bechamel’ - one of the 5 “mother” sauces of french cooking
