Poaching Eggs

- Water should be barely simmering
- Crack the eggs on a flat surface - try not to use the rim (why?)
- the freshness of the eggs matters a lot - the fresher the better and you'll
  struggle to poach eggs older than 4 days
- Add vinegar (vinegar lowers the coagulation temp. of the egg white)
- Add salt - it directly aids in coagulation
- Can par-cook it in shell (a julia child trick)
    - Prick shell (to avoid rapid expansion breaking the shell) and gently lower
      egg into the water for 15-20 seconds.
    - Then remove it and a crack shell and put it into water as normal
- Cooking time is 3-5 mins (3=runny, 5=hard)
