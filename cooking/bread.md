Notes

- Followed instructions
- Not all dough balls rose the same way in Fridge - one is quite a bit flatter -
  why?

Questions

Do I want a thicker crust? fast bake

Bake #1

- I heated oven to as hot as I could get it (280-290 C) and heated by cast iron
  pan
    - the dough was almost overcooked on underneath
    - had a thin crust
        - I assume the fast cook time contributed
    - I cooked it for 8 mins ish - it was undercooked but was about to become
      too brown
    - I preheated the oven for approx 1hr
    - I probably overheated the pan

Verdict: Ok but not great

Bake #2

- Dough was in Fridge for 6 days - had nice ripe bananas smell, had risen to
  double its size
- Pre-heat oven to 260 C (it oscillated between 250-260 C because my oven's not
  great)
- Putting cast-iron pan in at start for 30 min
- Baked for 12 mins
- Browning was good, both bottom and top - not too brown on the bottom/pan side
- Thin crust from the fast bake - not sure if that's good or bad?

Verdict: decent

Bake #3

Same setup as #2 but it was under cooked.
