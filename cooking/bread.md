Notes

* Followed instructions
* Not all dough balls rose the same way in Fridge - one is quite a bit flatter - why?

Questions

Do I want a thicker crust? fast bake

Bake #1

* I heated oven to as hot as I could get it (280-290 C) and heated by cast iron pan
    * the dough was almost overcooked on underneath
    * had a thin crust
        * I assume the fast cook time contributed
    * I cooked it for 8 mins ish - it was undercooked but was about to become too brown
    * I preheated the oven for approx 1hr
    * I probably overheated the pan

Verdict: Ok but not great

Bake #2

* Dough was in Fridge for 6 days - had nice ripe bananas smell, had risen to double its size
* Pre-heat oven to 260 C (it oscillated between 250-260 C because my oven's not great)
* Putting cast-iron pan in at start for 30 min
* Baked for 12 mins
* Browning was good, both bottom and top - not too brown on the bottom/pan side
* Thin crust from the fast bake - not sure if that's good or bad?

Verdict: decent
