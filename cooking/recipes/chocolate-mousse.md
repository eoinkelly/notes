This is a **very** rich mousse. The quantities below make enough for 8-10 people.

## Ingredients (8-10 servings)

* 125g cream cheese
* 0.5 cup sugar
* generous pinch salt
* 1 egg
* 250g Cadbury Premium Dark Cooking Chocolate (or any high quality chocolate)
* 600ml thickened cream, lightly whipped

## Ingredients (4-5 servings)

* 75g cream cheese (ish)
* 0.25 cup sugar
* pinch salt
* 1 small egg
* 125g Cadbury Premium Dark Cooking Chocolate (or any high quality chocolate)
* 300ml thickened cream, lightly whipped

    TODO: tweak these volumes - I got these numbers by division not experience

## Method

1. Let the cream cheese get to room temperature
    * It's almost impossible to combine the cream cheese if it's straight from the fridge
2. Beat the cream cheese, sugar and egg together until smooth.
3. Break the chocolate into small pieces and melt over a double boiler or in the microwave.
4. Add the melted chocolate to the cream cheese mixture and stir through until well combined.
    * Tip: add slowly. This is probably OTT because there is only one egg and it's already combined with other ingredients but we definitely don't want scrambled eggs...
5. Whip the cream
    * this is thickened cream so be careful here
6. Stir in the cream, again stirring until well combined.
7. Chill until required.
