# Pulled Pork

## Ingredients

- 2 medium yellow onions, thinly sliced
- 4 medium garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- 1 cup chicken stock (reduced salt if possible)
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar (alternatives: molasses)
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- 1 tablespoon salt (only if you have reduced-salt stock)
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
- a good dash of vinegar
- a dash of wostestshire sauce
- 1 pork shoulder (boneless or bone-in)
- 1 cup barbecue/HP sauce
- 2-3 star anaise
- 2-3 cardamom pods

## Steps

- Put everything in the slow cooker.
- Cook on low until the meat peels easily with a fork (10-12 hours on low)
- Pull the pork apart with a fork and remove any bone and excess fat.

## Notes

- Leave any fat on the pork while cooking as it will baste the meat. You can
  remove any excess fat when you are pulling the pork at the end.

## Research on pulled pork

_these are just rough notes and can be ignored_

Pulled pork can have a

- tomato based sauce
- mustard based sauce
- vinegar based sauce

### Alton brown version

cooked at 210f (98 C) for 10-12 hours

how hot is my slow cooker on low?

http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/pulled-pork-recipe.html Meat is
done when it falls apart easily when pulling with a fork. Once done, remove from
pot and set aside to rest for at least 1 hour. Pull meat apart with 2 forks

the pork should have

- lots of collagen which will be converted to gellatin during the long cooking
  process
- enough fat on the outside to baste the meat during the long cooking process

brines

- can be hot or cold
    - hot can open the spices and herbs you
- cold brine pumps up the cells with moisture and seasoning pickling salt is
  made to dissolve in cold fluid
- regular table sugar won’t dissolve in cold water (really?) so he uses
  molasses - could also use corn syrup (he says. Could you just make a sugar
  syrup? Molasses also brings other flavours to the dish

when propane gas burns it creates wator vapour which creates a protective
barrier between the meat and the heat use whole seed/fruit spices whenpossible
as the flavour is safely locked in ther till you use them. the aromatic oils in
them are volatile so they will dissapate when exposed to air

smoking

soft woods have resin which makes bad flavour when burned - prefer to burn
hardwoods you want smoke but no flames because soot tastes bad and is bad for
you you want to keep the meat between 98-104 C for the duration of the 8-12 hr
smoke liquid smoke is made by burning hickory, condensing the smoke and maki

long slow cooking works

- a long slow cook (around 100 C) breaks down the collagen to gelatin
- it does overcook the muscle fibres (but you don’t notice because of the
  lubricating effect of the gelatin
- we are not cooking to doneness, we are cooking to tenderness
- if you roasted the same bit of meat (a short hot cook), the muscle fibres
  would probably be less overcooked but the gelatin would not have broken down
  (this would mean the meat is still tough)
