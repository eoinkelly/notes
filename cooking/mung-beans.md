## dal recipes

Most dal recipes are quite simple to prepare. The standard preparation begins
with boiling a variety of dal (or a mix) in water with some turmeric, salt to
taste, and then adding a fried garnish at the end of the cooking process. In
some recipes, tomatoes, tamarind, unripe mango, or other ingredients are added
while cooking the dal, often to impart a sour flavour.

The fried garnish for dal goes by many names, including chaunk and tadka. The
ingredients in the chaunk for each variety of dal vary by region and individual
tastes. The raw spices (more commonly cumin seeds, mustard seeds, asafoetida,
and sometimes fenugreek seeds and dried red chili pepper) are first fried for a
few seconds in the hot oil on medium/low heat. This is generally followed by
ginger, garlic, and onion, which are generally fried for 10 minutes. After the
onion turns golden brown, ground spices (turmeric, coriander, red chili powder,
garam masala, etc.) are added. The chaunk is then poured over the cooked dal.
