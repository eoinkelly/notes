# Terraform

Questions

* I presume terraform should have its own IAM user?

Basics

1. you describe your infrastructure in config files
1. terraform generates an execution plan from them
    * before it does it you can inspect
        1. what terrafrom will do
        1. what order it will do it
    * `terrafrom plan` will examine the current state of resources and your desired state and show you what actions it intends to take to bring them together
    * terraform docs tout this separation of planning & execution phases as an advantage of terraform
1. terraform runs the plan
    * it builds a resource graph from your config and it will run any steps it can in parallel

Config file format

Docs: https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html

* two formats
    1. .tf
        * a text file format (looks a little rubyish fwiw)
        * recommended if config generated by human
    1. .tf.json
        * recommended if config generated by machine

Commands

* `terraform plan`
    * show you want terraform will do on next execution
* `terraform plan -destroy`
    * show what a `terraform destroy` will do
* `terraform graph`
    * show the resource graph
* `terraform apply`
    * actually run the plan
    * it saves the current state of your infrastructure into a .tfstate (JSON) file
* `terraform show`
    * inspect current state
* `terraform destroy`
    * destroy the infrastructure


Tutorial

```
cd path/to/config
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
terraform show
terraform destroy
```

Interesting things

* You can automate Heroku setups with it
* Terraform can provision containers into K8s and friends
* Apparently it works across all the major public clounds
* Designed to be used alongside chef & puppet - it doesn't do config managment of a single server
