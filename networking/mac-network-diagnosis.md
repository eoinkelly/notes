# DNS servers

* by default router acts as DNS forwarder (setup via DHCP) but you can add your
  own in System Preferences > Network

```
Spark NZ
Primary DNS: 122.56.237.1
SecondaryDNS: 210.55.111.1

Google DNS
https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/
8.8.8.8
8.8.4.4
```

* can manually specify DNS servers
* Aside: `/etc/resolv.conf` is auto-generated by mac OS and is **not** the primary source of dns info

```
scutil --dns # shows some DNS stuff in system configuration
```

# whois lookups

Network utility on mac is pretty handy for this

The NZ Registry services whois is at:

```
whois.srs.net.nz.
```

QUESTION: how does 'lookup' on mac network utility work? It doesn't seem to!

# What are DNS search domains?

* Domains you add to here are searched if you type a bareword into a browser
address bar or [other places ???].
    * TODO: I couldn't get safari to us them as it just did a google search.
        * Maybe figure out where these would actually be used by the system.
* Useful in a corporate setting. Can be ignored in a home setting.

# Steps to diagnose a network issue

Steup a bunch of pings to look for latency and dropped packets

first test without relying on DNS lookup

1. Figure out what gateway the machine uses
1. Setup a ping to the gateway IP
1. TODO: figure out how to see what DNS servers gateway is using. Via DHCP?
1. ping the primary and secondary DNS IPs

TODO: finish this

Q: How do you check that a machine is alive if it does not respond to ping?
