# CoreDNS

https://coredns.io/

- A DNS server, an alternative to BIND etc.
- almost all functionality outsourced to plugins
- it operates a bit like Rack but for DNS requests not HTTP requests
- plugins can
    - generate a response themselves
    - generate no response but have some side effect e.g. metrics or cache
    - communicate with kubernetes to provide service discovery
    - read from a file or database
- 30 plugins in default install, many more available
- performs
    - DNS
    - Service Discovery
- written in go
- chains plugins
- each plugin performs a DNS function e.g.
    - k8s service discovery
    - prometheus metrics
    - rewriting queries
    - serving zone files (old-school dns behaviour)
- integrates with k8s via k8s plugin
- integrates with etcd via plugin
- has plugins for major cloud dns services too e.g. route53
- configuring is in `Corefile`
- tries to have sane defaults

- defines 1+ server blocks which are groups of settings for a particular zone
- each server block
    - can specify which port it is listening on
    - you can have multiple server blocks listening on same port
    - you can bind to multiple ports
    - defines a chain of plugins to run the request through
- supports DNS, DNS over TLS, DNS over HTTP2 DNS over gRPC
