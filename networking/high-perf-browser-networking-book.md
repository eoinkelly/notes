# High performance browser networking

## Part 1

Definitions

- Latency: the time for a packet to get from source to destination
    - it is a _time_ e.g. 3ms, 4s
    - it can also be phrased as a _delay_
    - note it is not the same as RTT
- Bandwidth: the maximum "throughput" of a logical or physical communication
  path
    - throughput = a _rate_ i.e. `{packets/thingies} per {unit-time}`
    - througput = the rate of successful message delivery of the channel

Latency of networks is the sum of 4 delays:

1. Propagation delay
    - time for message to travel from sender to receiver
    - depends on
        1. distance
        2. medium through which the packet travels
    - refractive index = the factor by which propagation is slower in medium X
      than it is in light
        - optical fibre ~ 1.5
2. Transmission delay
    - time required to push all the packet bits onto the link
    - depends on
        1. lenght of packet
        2. data rate of the link
    - examples
        - a 10Mbps link vs a 100Mbps link and a 10Mb file
            - 10Mbps link takes 1s of transmission delay
            - 100Mbps link takes 0.1s of transmission delay
3. Processing delay
    - time required (on the receiver) to process packet header, check for
      bit-level errors and determine packet destination.
    - depends on
        - peformance of the receiver
4. Queueing delay
    - time (on receiver side) that the incoming packet is waiting on a queue to
      be processed
    - only occurs if the packets arrive at a faster rate than the router can
      handle
    - depends on
        - the speed of the router
        - how many packets are on the link (aka load)

    Aside: large incoming buffers can break TCPs backoff algorithm and have an
    overall negative effect on network performance

- Latency not bandwidth is the reason most websites are slow
- `traceroute` can be used to measure latency of each hop along the path to a
  server
