> An expression is referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its
> value without changing the meaning of the program. In mathematical functions,
> all applications are referentially transparent: a function with a certain
> input will always produce a certain output, and therefore, it can be replaced
> by its value. This is a powerful property that allows mathematicians to reason
> about their "code" in interesting ways

> There is an interesting correspondence between how queries embedded in
> application code crystallize and come to represent the data they retrieve and
> the referential transparency of mathematical functions.

> Pure functional programming is a specific case of Declarative programming, a
> fact that has far reaching implications and is precisely the kind of insight
> that has gotten me so hooked on this book.
