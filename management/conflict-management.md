> We do an "experience" session that specifically is meant to call out topics in
> ownership, collaboration, and learning & improvement -- generally questions
> regarding conflict management are brought up during this session and includes
> sample topics such as:
>
> - Tell me about a difficult person youâ€™ve had to deal with. How did you handle
>   interactions with that person?
> - Tell me about a time you had a disagreement with your manager /direct
>   report, and how did you deal with it?
> - Tell me about a time you had to convince team members your solution was the
>   right one.
> - Tell me about a time another team declined to implement a feature/fix you
>   requested. How did you go about dealing with this situation and what was the
>   outcome? If red flags come up, then you dig deeper.
