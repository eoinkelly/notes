# Managing Humans

- A lot of management is about problem solving
    - a set of people want a particular outcome

> a great manager is someone with whom you can make a connection no matter where
> you sit in the organization chart

> great managers work hard to see the subtle differences in each of the people
> working with them.

> its you ability to construct an insightful opinion of people in seconds whic
> will make you a great manager

> it is your fulltime job to listen to the people you work with and mentally
> document how they are built.

You aren't actually going to write the code or hit the deadlines, your team is
going todo these things and your job is managing the team!

Organisations are messy people are constantly moving around

> you believe because you understand your own job best, yours is more important
> than anybody elses

> you are not talking to a person when you talk to your manager, you are talking
> to the organisation

> You will always learn something in your 1:1 Questions

- How do I learn from the people who report to me?
- Is there an "SRE" approach to management i.e. minimize toil work?

Aside: 9 direct reports seems to be the recommended max?

Tasks

Tools of management

- existing relationships with people
    - knowing what they will respond well/badly to
- experience at having seen situations before and
    - no short-cut here
- seeing other managers do their thing
    - ???

Guiding questions for getting to know somebody as a manager:

- how do they deal with a crisis?
- How do they communicate?
- What motivates them?

For managers in particular

- How do they lead when things are going well?
- How do they lead when things are going badly?

You should also get to know your own manager

Your manager is your face to the rest of the organisation

Questions to ask to understand your own manager:

1. Where does your managewr come from?
1. How is he compensating for his blind spots?
    - a managers job is to surround themselves by people who can compensate for
      their weaknesses
1. How much action does the manager take per decision? i.e. do they get shit
   done or just talk about it?
1. Where are they in the political food chain?
    - Are they a _player_, _pawn_, or _free electron_?
    - Your manager represents you after all
1. What happens when they lose their shit?

Good interview question: where do you need help?
