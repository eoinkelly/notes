## Digital versions: Tone Master Black & Blonde

There are 2 "Tone master" versions of the amp

-   One is black and one is cream (called _DR Blonde_)
    -   the cream one has different (less scooped) speaker
        -   many reviews say the speaker is better especially when you use gain pedals
    -   the black one has a firmware update you can apply to get the changes in the cream (unsure if
        you can go back)
-   black retails for approx NZD 2300 (almost half cost of original)
    -   blonde is 2600 NZD new
-   100 watt digital power amp
-   emulates the 22 watt DR digitally
-   has near identical front-panel to original
-   has XLR output and IR cab sims built in
-   mute switch for silent stage and recording
-   USB for firmware
-   Pros/cons
    -   -- 2 year warranty, unsure what happens after that
    -   ++ cheaper than tube DR
    -   ++ much much lighter
    -   -- when a newer version comes out the resale of it will plummet
    -   -- quite limited as a digital modelling amp (compared to similar price competitors
    -   ++ very simple to use especially if you are familiar with the old DRs
