# Katana

9 presets available including the panel

all accessible from top panel

panel effects can be set beforehand
the knob on panel changes one charactersitc of the effect
so really the panel is kind of amp + pedalboard where each pedal on the board has only one knob (everything else set in software)

## panel "preset"

* 5 amps
	* bass-mid-treble eq for each amp
	* master volume
	* presence control (TODO: what does that do exactly?)
* pedalboard with 15 pedals (5 of which can be active) (each pedal has one knob, all other settings set beforehand)
	1. 3 boost pedals (can turn one one at a time)
	2. 3 modulation pedals (can turn one one at a time)
	3. 3 effects pedals (can turn one one at a time)
	4. 3 delay pedals (can turn one one at a time)
	5. 3 delay+reverb chains (one chain active, chain can have just reverb, just delay or both)
* software only (from pov of playing live, these are hard-coded for the panel preset)
	* noise gate for the preset
	* send & return volume knobs
	* expression pedal set up (what it controls and how it controls it)
	* cab simulation
	* ?? solo mode
	* ?? tone shape global eq with 3 presets + off
	* ?? contour


The boss software shows you the hardware knobs on the artist mk2 - not all are on my 100 mk2

### Solo

* Lets you have both a rhythm and lead volume levels
* Controls
	* On/Off button
	* 0-100 knob

### Contour

* A way to quickly change you tone in subtle ways
* has hardware control on artist version

### Tone shape global EQ

* a single eq which can be inserted at one of
    * input
    * output
    * SP out
    * line out
* the presets do not change where it is inserted - it is a "global"
* has 3 color presets
	* the artist head has a button to change between them, mine doesn't
* each preset can be parametric or 10-band (GE-10) style

## Variation

Each amp model has a "variation" version which is just a brighter/clearer/punchier/hotter version
