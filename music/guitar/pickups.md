On a single-coil pickup, its output voltage can typically range from 100 to 200 mV. In double-coil pickups or humbuckers, they are usually found around 200 mV for the purest vintage-style models, 300 mV for medium-gain models, and up to 500 mV for the most extreme models.


This would be on passive pickup models. In active pickups things change a lot, as this type of circuit incorporates a preamplifier powered by a 9 volt battery. For this reason, active pickups can exceed 1 volt output, as in the case of the popular EMG 81 and 85.

I make pickups and what I've seen from mine is generally single coil pickups have an average peak around 100-200mV, max peak of 300-400mV. Humbucker you can double those numbers. If you use particularly strong magnets and/or get the pickups very close to the strings, you get potentially double that again, but likely only 50% increase. Overwound gets more too, but physical constraints make it impractical to do that too far, unless they use smaller gauge wire.


Regardless, the output of a pickup is very small, we use high input impedance amps and pedals to minimize pickup current output and loading of the pickups.

The few Duncan pups I measured way back when generated around 250mv to 350mv. That was with my strumming, of course. So, a 350mv pulse, into a 500k pot, would draw around 700nA's. Thats .0007ma. Very small.


he pickup generates an AC signal and sends it to the amplifier, via the various pots and switches. The amplifier then takes this weak signal (measured in millivolts and typically never exceeding 2 volts) and through a series of gain stages, boosts the signal to a voltage and amperage that can drive the speakers.

Pickups use inducatance to create current - similar to how a generator does

Pickups vary in inductance from 2H to 10H
More turns = higher inductance
More ferromagnetic core material = higher inductance
Stronger magnet = higher inductance (within limits, a strong enough magnet damp the vibrations of the string)

Given a coil with the same magnetic material and same wire with the same number of turns, 
if it is wound fat + wide it will have higher inducatance than tall and narrow
