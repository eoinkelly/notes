Numbers below based on 25.5" scale length and standard tuning.

I use light-heavy 10-52

```
For my 10-52 set

Pressure (from high E4 to low E2):
    16
    15
    17
    28
    26
    22

Total: 124

Notes:
* D string has most tension
* would strings have a lot more tension
```

## Ernie ball regular slinky 10-46

EB don't publish tension charts so I'm guessing by plugging the EB gauges into
https://tension.stringjoy.com/

```
Assume 25.5" scale length
Tension in lbs (high E -> low E)

	17.8
	16.9
	18.2
	20
	20.3
	18.3

Total tension: 111.5 lbs

Notes
* A string has most tension
* The diff between wound and unwound strings is much smaller than with the Elixir light-heavy (unsurprising)
```

## String tension and string feel

Imagine 10m of kitchen string

If you place you hands 10cm apart and pull you feel very little give

If you pull from the full 10m you get much more give

=> a given string is more elastic the longer it is?

This factor is very small given the differences in string lengths on a guitar headstock and other
factors matter a lot more but it is small but perceptible for some people

## Elixir string coatings

-   green optiweb = thinnest, newest, not available in as many gauges as nanoweb
-   orange nanoweb = middle, largest range
-   blue polyweb = thickest, not available in as many gauges as nanoweb

## Ernie ball coated strings

Ernie ball have coated strings too

they call their process for putting down the layer of polymer an "Everlast" treatment
