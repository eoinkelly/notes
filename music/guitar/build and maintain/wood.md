      reasons

## Glues

TODO

## Construction

### Fretboard

- can be finished or unfinished
- can have binding or not
- Measurements
    - Radius
        - Can be different at either end of the neck

### Bindings

- Can be around the edges of the body
- can be on edges of fretboard
- How
    - A groove is cut out then the binding is glued in
- Binding materials
    - ??? plastic
    - ? other things

### Fretwire

- Nickel or Stainless steel
- Fret wire - height and thickness
    - neck finish changes how tall you perceive the frets to be
    - TODO: what are my preferences here?

### Pickups

- measure output with multi-meter
    - TODO: learn how to do this

### Truss rod

- Measurements
    - back-bow (bad)
    - straight
    - forward bow (relief)
    - Straight or slight forward-bow is good

### Neck

- Attach to body
    - Bolt-on
        - Neck bolted on
        - Basically all Fenders are bolt-on
    - Set neck
        - Neck glued in
        - Gibsons are mostly set neck
        - The hole in the body where the neck is glued in is called the "tenon"
            - Tenon can be short or long
    - Neck through body
        - neck + center of body is one piece. Wings attached to body to fill out
          the shape
- Profile
    - C shape
        - Fender modern C/Flat oval
        - Most common on modern guitars
    - U shape
        - Common on vintage guitars because C was hard to make
        - U's became C's with a lot of use
        - Can be comfy if you have big hands
    - D shape
        - between a C and a U
        - chunky C
    - V shape
        - Good to anchor your hand on back of neck
        - Hard V: Dimebag guitars
        - Soft V: SRV guitars, Eric Johnson
- The "neck" wood doesn't seem to normally include the fretboard
- Neck can be one piece of wood (single ply) or multiple pieces (multi-ply)
    - Gibson/Fender seem to use one piece
    - Ibanez seem to use multiple pieces glued together
        - apparently this adds strengths
- Scale length
    - Fender longer, Gibson shorter, PRS in between
        - PRS 594 = 24.594" scale
- Tone impact: minimal
