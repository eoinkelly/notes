# Semi-hollow body guitars

# Basics

-   Semi-hollow body
    -   a block of wood down the center
        -   stiffer than an acoustic with a brighter tone
    -   usually but not always has f-holes
        -   removing the f-holes helps reduce feedback
    -   less feedback than a full hollow body but more than a solid body
