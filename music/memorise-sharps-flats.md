# Memorising sharps and flats order

On the circle of fifths, notes are sharpened in this order moving clockwise from
C (no sharps)

```
F# C# G# D# A# E#

"Father Charles Goes Down After Eating Breakfast."
```

On circle of 4ths, flats are added in this order moving out from C (no flats)

```
Bb Eb Ab Db Gb Cb

"Battle Ends And Down Goes Charles' Father."
```

A really easy way to memorize it is to realize that

- FMaj is technically a flat key (has Bb) but does not have "flat" in its name
- the number of sharps and flats for the key signature of a letter always adds
  up to 7.
    - Examples:
        - Bb has 2 flats and B has 5 sharps 2+5=7,
        - Ab has 4 flats and A has 3 sharps 4+3=7,
        - Db has 5 flats and D has 2 sharps 5+2=7, and this works for every
          letter on the circle of fifths.

Don't mix # and b :

- some scales use #, other use b, never both ! (It's a small lie, but it's
  useless to go more complex for now).
- The major scales that will use b : Gb, Db, Ab, Eb, Bb, F (easy to remember :
  Gb, then always UP a fifth !).
    - So, most of the time, we use Gb major, and not F# major !
- The major scales that will use # : G, D, A, E, B (easy to remember : G, then
  always UP a fifth !).
- Where is C ? Well, no # neither b ! It's in the middle, between F major and G
  major if you will !

To sum it up : Here are all the major scales :

```
Gb - Db - Ab - Eb - Bb - F - C - G - D - A - E - B

easy to remember : Gb, then always up a fifth!
```

#### sharp memorisation trick

Now : how to know what are the b in Gb major ? Or the # in A major for example
??? Here is the famous trick : trick (to use only with # scales !) :

Let's take A major. Ask yourself :

what # is just before A ? It's G#, right ? So the # in A major are all the # (in
the order you learnt) up to G# : so F# - C# - G# !

Another example : B major. What # is just before B ? It's A#, right ? So the #
in B major are all the # up to A# : F# - C# - G# - D# - A# (so, B major is : B -
C# - D# - E - F# - G# - A#) !

#### flat memorisation trick

b trick (to use only with b scales !) :

Let's take Ab major. Ask : what is the next b after Ab in the order of b you
learnt ?

It's Db, right ? So the b in Ab major are all the b up to Db : Bb - Eb - Ab - Db
!

Another example : Bb major. Ask : what is the next b after Bb in the order of b
you learnt ? It's Eb, right ? So the b in Bb major are all the b up to Eb : Bb -
Eb (so, Bb major is : Bb - C - D - Eb - F - G - A) !

By the way, small info : Fb does exist, it's the same note as E on your keyboard
