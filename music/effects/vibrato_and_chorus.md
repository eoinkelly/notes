# Vibrato and Chorus

-   Volume modulation = Tremolo
-   Pitch modulation = Vibrato

Using vibrato

-   can be used subtle as an always on
-   can be used more full on for creative effects

History

-   1950's Fender Stratocaster
    -   had an arm attached to guitar bridge = mechanical vibrato
    -   called a Tremolo arm but it's actually vibrato
-   1967
    -   Uni-vibe
        -   first electronic vibrato device
        -   presumably also the first chorus?
        -   has 2 modes:
            1. Vibrato mode
                - No clean signal in output
            2. Chorus mode
                - mixes the clean signal into the wet vibrato signal
-   1982
    -   Boss VB-2
        -   The definitive guitar pitch vibrato effect
        -   2016 released waza-craft version

# Chorus = vibrato + clean signal

-   A chorus pedal is a vibrato pedal that leaves your clean signal in
-   They also delay the wet signal a bit I think
-   Electronic chorus and vibrato were invented at the same time (in the Uni-vibe)
-   Not all chorus pedals let you do vibrato (i.e. let you drop the clean signal)

Making chorus from scratch in a DAW

1. Duplicate the clean signal in a new track
2. Delay the wet track by a small amount e.g. 20ms
3. Apply a pitch modulation wave to the wet track
    - :question: Is convolve the right term to use?
    - choose the following for the wave
        - wave shape: sine -> square
        - wave amplitude = depth
        - wave frequency = rate
