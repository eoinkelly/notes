# Vibrato and Chorus

- Volume modulation = Tremolo
- Pitch modulation = Vibrato

Using vibrato

- can be used subtle as an always on
- can be used more full on for creative effects

History

- 1950's Fender Stratocaster
    - had an arm attached to guitar bridge = mechanical vibrato
    - called a Tremolo arm but it's actually vibrato
- 1967
    - Uni-vibe
        - first electronic vibrato device
        - presumably also the first chorus?
        - has 2 modes:
            1. Vibrato mode
                - No clean signal in output
            2. Chorus mode
                - mixes the clean signal into the wet vibrato signal
- 1982
    - Boss VB-2
        - The definitive guitar pitch vibrato effect
        - 2016 released waza-craft version

# Chorus = vibrato + clean signal

- A chorus pedal is a vibrato pedal that leaves your clean signal in
- They also delay the wet signal a bit I think
- Electronic chorus and vibrato were invented at the same time (in the Uni-vibe)
- Not all chorus pedals let you do vibrato (i.e. let you drop the clean signal)

Making chorus from scratch in a DAW

1. Duplicate the clean signal in a new track
2. Delay the wet track by a small amount e.g. 20ms
3. Apply a pitch modulation wave to the wet track
    - :question: Is convolve the right term to use?
    - choose the following for the wave
        - wave shape: sine -> square
        - wave amplitude = depth
        - wave frequency = rate
