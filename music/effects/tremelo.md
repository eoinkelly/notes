# Tremolo

-   Volume modulation = Tremolo
-   Pitch modulation = Vibrato
-   Guitar bridges do vibrato not tremolo
-   Fingers on strings do vibrato not tremolo

-   vintage amps (with a few exceptions) have tremolo circuits (not vibrato), and guitars have
    vibrato systems (not tremolo).

## Types of tremolo (in amps)

### Bias tremolo

-   The output tube bias is modulated which modulates the overall gain (average transconductance of
    the output tubes, more specifically), but also modulates the amount of crossover distortion and
    the output impedance.
-   Most of the gain reduction happens in the middle of the waveform, so the depth of the tremolo
    effect changes with level.
-   Bias tremolo was used mostly in the tweed and smaller brownface amps.
-   Some of the bigger brownface amps had the short-lived harmonic tremolo circuit.
-   The later blackface amps were mostly optical tremolo, with the exception of the Princeton, which
    had bias tremolo.
