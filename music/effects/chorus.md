# Vibrato

-   Volume modulation = Tremolo
-   Pitch modulation = Vibrato
-   1950's Fender Strat
    -   had an arm attached to guitar bridge = mechanical vibrato

            2. Chorus mode
                - mixes the clean signal into the wet vibrato signal

    -   can be used subtle as an always on
    -   can be used more full on for creative effects

# Chorus is vibrato + clean signal

-   A chorus pedal is a vibrato pedal that leaves your clean signal in
-   They also delay the wet signal a bit I think
-   Electronic chorus and vibrato were invented at the same time (in the Uni-vibe)
-   Not all chorus pedals let do vibrato (i.e. let you drop the clean signal)

Q: how does flager fit into this?
