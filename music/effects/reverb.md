# Reverb

## Overview

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyOqgwmaJ8k

-   naturally occurring as sound waves bounce around a space
-   we can't usually record in reverberant spaces and also these don't give us almost any control
    over the sound Recording studios are deliberately dry (with sound padding) so artificial reverbs
    are popular.
-   Recording studios sometimes had "Echo chambers" (a room with a mic) to avoid the "dry and close"
    signal.
    -   The room size, dimensions and materials all changed the character of the chamber
    -   Original plate reverbs were a cheaper alternative to building a whole room
-   "reverb is just a room"
-   it's kind of an audio fingerprint of the room/space you are in
    -   how sound waves bounce off the surfaces and reflect back to you
-   Reverb should almost certainly live at the end of your chain
-   there are lots of random pedals which add various kinds of modulation to the reverb

## Anatomy of reverb sound

-   Early reflections (5-100ms) - contains most of information our brains need about the shape of
    the space
-   Tail/reverberant field - 100ms+ the wash of reflections

## 4 kinds of reverb used on recording

1. Natural reverb
    - Use a real room
2. Electromechanical devices (e.g. spring, plate)
    - Somewhat simulate natural reverb but also have their own character now
3. Algorithmic reverbs
    - Digital processing to emulate various kinds of reverb
4. Convolution reverbs
    - captures the reverb characteristics of a real space

## Types of reverb

1. Plate
    - Sounds bright and smooth
    - They don't sound like a natural space
    - Good on vocals, guitars and snare drums
    - Originally a mechanical reverb in recording studios
    - Mimics large metal plates that studios have
    - In pedals it is always done digitally?
    - Bit more metallic than hall reverb
2. Spring reverb
    - sounds:
        - very distinctive spiraling sound
        - bad on drums, good on electric guitar because it can enhance the groove
    - created by Bell labs to fix issues in long distance phone lines
    - signal is split and wet signal sent through the springs and then mixed with dry signal
    - picked up by Hammond organs who added an external "reverb unit" you could plug into the organ
      to make it sound like it's in a big cathedral
    - 1960's Dick Dale and surf rock started using spring reverb on guitars and vocals
    - the reverb of surf music
    - Many amps have spring reverbs built in
    - Dale asked Leo Fender to put the organ unit in a guitar pedal
    - 1961 Fender leases the Hammond unit and released Fender reverb head unit
        - About the size of an amp head
        - had a big spring tank
3. Reverb made from bucket brigade chips
    - this approach never really worked
4. Hall
    - Sounds
        - Designed with acoustics in mind
        - Great for acoustic instruments
    - An example of an algorithmic reverb
    - Always digital
    - Used everywhere in 80's 90's
5. Octave (Shimmer) reverb
    - Mixes reverb with high and low octave effects
    - Pioneered by Eno inserting octave effects into reverb
    - Used by U2 on Unforgettable Fire
6. Convolution reverb
    - A captured Impulse Response of a real spaces and mechanical items (e.g. springs and plates).
    - You capture with a mic and making a noise like a clap or pistol
    - You can capture your own IRs and add them
