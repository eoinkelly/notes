## Overview

-   naturally occurring as sound waves bounce around a space
-   "reverb is just a room"
-   it's kind of an audio fingerprint of the room/space you are in
    -   how sound waves bounce off the surfaces and reflect back to you
-   Reverb should almost certainly live at the end of your chain
-   Multi-reverb pedals
    -   EHX Oceans 11 Multi reverb
    -   Boss RV series of pedals
    -   JHS 3 Series Reverb (does a variation of reverb sounds)

## Types of reverb

1. Spring reverb
    - created by Bell labs to fix issues in long distance phone lines
    - picked up by Hammond organs who added an external "reverb unit" you could plug into the organ
      to make it sound like it's in a big cathedral
    - 1960's Dick Dale and surf rock started using spring reverb on guitars and vocals
    - Dale asked Leo Fender to put the organ unit in a guitar pedal
    - 1961 Fender leases the Hammond unit and released Fender reverb head unit
        - About the size of an amp head
        - had a big spring tank
    - Pedals
        - Source Audio True Spring (apparently a faithful recreation of a spring reverb)
        - Caitlinbread Topanga (spring reverb)
        - TC Electronic Drip
    - Pedals w Real springs
        - Anasounds pedals have actual spring tanks + a control pedal
        - Danelectro Spring King
            - has pad you can kick to nudge the springs
        - Echofix spring meter - fancy
2. Plate
    - Mimics large metal plates that studios have
    - Pedals
        - Strymon Blue Sky

    - Always digital
    - Used everywhere in 80's 90's
    - Pedals
        - Hall of Fame

    - Mixes reverb with high and low octave effects
