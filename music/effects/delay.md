## Background

-   Sources
    -   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mscNnqNXizQ
-   Types of delay:
    1. Tape delay
        - a rotating tape has one record head and 1+ play heads at configurable distances (delays) after the dry sound
        - original delay
        - flat and dull
        - most used for slap-back
        - Examples
            - Dunlop Echoplex
            - JHS Milkman
            - Keely Echo's
            - Strymon El Capistan (well regarded)
    2. Analog (Bucket brigade)
        - based on a then newly released bucket brigade chipsets (basically big chains of capacitors)
            - different BB chips sound different
        - Every repeat gets worse (more lo-fi) but in a nice way
        - Examples
            - EHX Memory Man
            - Boss DM-2
            - JHS Cub
            - MXR Carbon copy (maybe most popular analog delay)
    3. Digital
        - early 80's arrived as rack units e.g. Roland SDE
        - digitizes the signal, runs computations and converts back to analog
        - you can get exact crisp delays for as long as you want
        - Played by
            - U2/Edge
        - Examples
            - Boss DD-2
            - Ibanez DDL
            - Strymon Dig
            - Boss DD-3T (has tap tempo)
    4. Analog controlled by digital
        - Like old-school analog delay but augmented with digital controls of the delay e.g. adds tap tempo
    5. Delay + Octaver = "shimmer"
        - repeats can be pitch-shifted
        - Examples
            - EHX Canyon
    6. Reverse delay
        - Sounds really cool I think
        - Like a looper with loops between 1ms - 2000ms (or thereabouts) and plays them back reversed and echos
        - Played by
            - Beatles white album
            - Hendrix red house solo
        - Examples
            - Boss DD-5
            - DanElectro Backtalk
    7. Multi-delay effects
        - Almost always digital
        - Replicates many kinds of delay
        - can include looper too
        - Examples
            - Line6 DL4
            - Boss D-200
            - TC Flashback

## Boss history

-   1976
    -   First Boss pedals from Roland
    -   Roland were already huge so they got new tech first
    -   Boss DM-1
        -   came out in 1976
        -   Boss DM-101 is an update of this in some respects
-   1981
    -   Boss DM-2 - the first compact analog delay
-   1982
    -   DD-2 - the first compact digital delay released
-   1983
    -   DM-3 - last analog bucket brigade delay they released for quite a while
        -   this is a Waza craft version now
    -   Roland SDE-3000 released
        -   famous rackmount digital delay
        -   Used by EVH among many others
        -   Boss SDE-3000D is a modern floor pedal reproduction and expansion of this
            -   SDE-3000EVH is an EVH branded version of the SDE-3000D

## Example delay usages

-   https://www.guitarworld.com/features/25-greatest-delay-moments
-   30ms, moderate wet =thicken lead
-   335ms, very low wet level = thicken lead
-   80-120, moderate wet = slapjack
-   Delay time in time w your playing = delay as a noticeable effect.
    -   1/4 note is usable if it's in time with you playing
    -   Dotted 8th notes to fill in between the notes you actually play is an The Edge thing

### Slap back

-   Used in country and rockabilly, chicken picking
-   Very short delay time

### Welcome to the jungle intro

-   [The record used a rack-mounted bit of gear that Mike Clink had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cx5oVDgtwg)
-   Slash uses Boss DD3

Opinion 1

-   Wet/dry mix = 50/50
-   Delay time = 150mx
-   Feedback (num echos) = 65%

Opinion 2

-   Use 2 delays at 300ms and 700ms

Opinion 3

-   Boss DD3
-   Level: 80%
-   Feedback: 85%
-   Delay time: 85%
-   Mode: 800ms

Opinion 4

-   https://www.guitarworld.com/artists/tone-secrets-behind-welcome-jungle-guns-roses-slash-gnr-appetite-destruction
-   Roland SRV-2000 Digital Reverb (set to 'secret' delay mode: hold down
    Reverb/Non Linear, Write and Room Simulate buttons while powering on; Delay
    Time: 318ms, Feedback: 30, Output: 50)â€”used on intro only; for 'stabs' and slide
    part increase delay time to 425ms and pair with an additional SRV-2000 in plate
    A reverb setting.

### Edge Joshua tree

stereo delay
he used Korg SDD-3000
dotted eight in one side
quarter note on the other channel
Q: I guess I'd need a interface with 2 guitar inputs to capture this

## Digital delays

-   3 broad (overlapping) categories of digital delays:
    1. Character delays
        - Delay has a character which we can tweak & filter
    2. Modelling delays
    3. Creative delays
-   Very early '80s
-   80's stereo rack delay sounds
    -   Rack units:
        -   TC-2290
        -   Korg SDD-3000
            -   Edge used this on Joshua Tree
        -   SDE-3000
    -   You need to run stereo delay to get the most out of this style
    -   Modern pedals to do 80's rack thing
        -   MXR Joshua Ambient Echo
        -   Strymon Dig
        -   TC Electronic Flashback
            -   available as a mini or a 2X4
        -   TC Electronic Nova Delay
            -   good value for money
            -   not available new
-   These rack digital delays were very popular because they were
    -   cleaner than analog
    -   longer delay times than analog
-   Modern digital delay
    -   Typically very clean repeats. So clean that you need EQ and filtering to avoid them clashing with your clean signal
    -   Examples
        -   Providence Chrono pedal
            -   24 bit samples
            -   modern
            -   has very clear repeats
            -   repeats sound very like the original
            -   can repeat for long delay times 2.7sec+
            -   has filters like other modern digital delays
        -   Future factory - Free the Tone
            -   very complicated looking digital delay
    -   You can create a version of chorus with some digital delays
-   1. Character delays
    -   1983
        -   Boss DD-2 launches
            -   basically the guts of an SDE-3000 in a compact form
    -   1986
        -   Boss DD-3 launches
            -   12 bit processor
                -   12 bit delays have "a sound"
                -   makes the delays warmer and characterful
                -   it's not as clear/pristine as digital delays
                -   doesn't have as many controls as others e.g. filtering, modulation
                -   it has a great sound but not as configurable as more modern ones
    -   DD-3t adds tap tempo
-   2. Modelling delays
    -   came about when processing power got good/cheap enough
    -   can mimic all other delays (digital, analog, tape etc.) plus creative stuff
    -   Examples
        -   Line6 DL4
        -   Boss DD-500
        -   Boss DD-200
        -   Strymon Timeline
        -   Boss SDE-3000D
            -   2 delays in one pedal
            -   because players would put 2 SDE-3000's in
        -   Boss SDE-3000EVH
            -   has a 3rd output for a dry output
-   3. Creative delays
    -   Out there effects
    -   Not really designed for regular playing but for creating specific kinds of sounds and ambience
    -   Examples
        -   Meris Polymoon
-   Jargon: _Analog dry through_
    -   The clean input is kept analog
    -   the wet signal goes through ADC -> Processing -> Dac -> Mixed w. analog clean signal
    -   Lots of the modern digital and modelling delays

## Delays and multiple amps

-   Examples
    -   Wet-dry (one amp for clean signal, one for the wet)
    -   Wet-dry-wet (dry signal in middle, stereo delay in the other 2)
