-   Types of delay:
    1. Tape delay
        - a rotating tape has one record head and 1+ play heads at configurable distances (delays) after the dry sound
        - original delay
        - flat and dull
        - most used for slap-back
        - Examples
            - Dunlop Echoplex
            - JHS Milkman
            - Keely Echo's
            - Strymon El Capistan (well regarded)
    2. Analog (Bucket brigade)
        - based on a then newly released bucket brigade chipsets (basically big chains of capacitors)
            - different BB chips sound different
        - Every repeat gets worse (more lo-fi) but in a nice way
        - Examples
            - EHX Memory Man
            - Boss DM-2
            - JHS Cub
            - MXR Carbon copy (maybe most popular analog delay)
    3. Digital
        - early 80's arrived as rack units e.g. Roland SDE
        - digitizes the signal, runs computations and converts back to analog
        - you can get exact crisp delays for as long as you want
        - Played by
            - U2/Edge
        - Examples
            - Boss DD-2
            - Ibanez DDL
            - Strymon Dig
            - Boss DD-3T (has tap tempo)
    4. Analog controlled by digital
        - Like old-school analog delay but augmented with digital controls of the delay e.g. adds tap tempo
    5. Delay + Octaver = "shimmer"
        - repeats can be pitch-shifted
        - Examples
            - EHX Canyon
    6. Reverse delay
        - Sounds really cool I think
        - Like a looper with loops between 1ms - 2000ms (or thereabouts) and plays them back reversed and echos
        - Played by
            - Beatles white album
            - Hendrix red house solo
        - Examples
            - Boss DD-5
            - DanElectro Backtalk
    7. Multi-delay effects
        - Almost always digital
        - Replicates many kinds of delay
        - can include looper too
        - Examples
            - Line6 DL4
            - Boss D-200
            - TC Flashback

Slap back

-   Used in country and rockabilly, chicken pickin'
-   Very short delay time
