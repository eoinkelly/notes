## Overview

-   Wah is a movable band filter
    -   Heel = lowest end of sweep
    -   Toe = highest end of freq sweep
-   Vintage/old wah tends to have a narrower sweep
-   Q = Q factor
    -   a measure of the width of band pass filter relative to a nominal full range of frequencies
    -   $$Q = \frac{1}{\text{fractional bandwidth}}$$
    -   High Q => narrow passband
    -   Low Q = wide passband
-   Invented 1966 by the American Thomas Organ Company
    -   they made a deal with Vox to built instruments and amplifiers for american market

## Anatomy of a wah

-   Sweep = the min and max frequency that you can move the band
    -   many pedals have multiple ranges you can choose via a switch
-   Q = the width of the band relative to the full band
    -   `Q = 1 / fractional_bandwidth`
-   An optional clean boost
    -   gives you a bit of extra boost for a solo
    -   can also compensate for volume lost through the wah
    -   sometimes has foot-switch on pedal to turn on/off
-   Buffered or true-bypass
    -   some pedals do both, some only one
    -   depends on how you intend to place it on board
-   Pedal size
    -   Wah pedals are pretty big but you can get small form factor versions
        -   would my feet be too big for them to be usable?
-   Pedal voice determined by
    -   parts choice, in particular the inductor(s)
    -   where the frequency range starts and ends
-   I/O jack placement
    -   most are on the side but you can get some top mounted
-   Status LEDs
    -   The basic crybaby doesn't have any indication when wah is on but many do
-   Auto return feature
    -   ++ wah automatically turns off and returns to heel when you take your foot off
    -   -- you get signal drop off when you intentionally use the heel because pedal considers it
        off
    -   -- you can't do a cocked wah thing with auto return

## Vox vs Dunlop

-   Basically same pedals
-   When Wah invented, only Vox dealers could sell Vox so Cry Baby brand invented to allow selling
    to other dealers
-   Later on Cry Baby brand bought by Dunlop
-   At one time Dunlop manufactured vox pedals under license
-   1982 Dunlop acquired the Thomas Organ company including the Cry Baby brand and all the original
    tooling and machinery for making the pedals. Company

## Aside: Dunlop

-   Dunlop also own the MXR and Way Huge pedal brands
    -   Way Huge was founded by Jeorge Tripps in LA originally. Their brand is "out there" pedals
-   Dunlop makes a lot of stuff: picks, strings, capos, slides, instrument maintenance gear and
    consumables, cables, straps, Straplok strap buttons (they own the Straplok brand), fret wire,
    guitar electronics, pedal board patch cables
