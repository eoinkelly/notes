## Overview

- Wah is a movable band filter
    - Heel = lowest end of sweep
    - Toe = highest end of freq sweep
- Vintage/old wah tends to have a narrower sweep
- Q = Q factor
    - a measure of the width of band pass filter relative to a nominal full
      range of frequencies
    - $$Q = \frac{1}{\text{fractional bandwidth}}$$
    - High Q => narrow passband
    - Low Q = wide passband
- Invented 1966 by the American Thomas Organ Company
    - they made a deal with Vox to built instruments and amplifiers for american
      market

## Wah songs

So so many.

- Marvin Gaye - What's going on
- Most Metallica
- Hendrix
- Clapton
- Gilmour

## Anatomy of a wah

- Sweep = the min and max frequency that you can move the band
    - many pedals have multiple ranges you can choose via a switch
- Q = the width of the band relative to the full band
    - `Q = 1 / fractional_bandwidth`
- An optional clean boost
    - gives you a bit of extra boost for a solo
    - can also compensate for volume lost through the wah
    - sometimes has foot-switch on pedal to turn on/off
- Buffered or true-bypass
    - some pedals do both, some only one
    - depends on how you intend to place it on board
- Pedal size
    - Wah pedals are pretty big but you can get small form factor versions
        - would my feet be too big for them to be usable?
- Pedal voice determined by
    - parts choice, in particular the inductor(s)
    - where the frequency range starts and ends
- I/O jack placement
    - most are on the side but you can get some top mounted
- Status LEDs
    - The basic crybaby doesn't have any indication when wah is on but many do
- Auto return feature
    - ++ wah automatically turns off and returns to heel when you take your foot
      off
    - -- you get signal drop off when you intentionally use the heel because
      pedal considers it off
    - -- you can't do a cocked wah thing with auto return

## Vox vs Dunlop

- Basically same pedals
- When Wah invented, only Vox dealers could sell Vox so Cry Baby brand invented
  to allow selling to other dealers
- Later on Cry Baby brand bought by Dunlop
- At one time Dunlop manufactured vox pedals under license
- 1982 Dunlop acquired the Thomas Organ company including the Cry Baby brand and
  all the original tooling and machinery for making the pedals. Company

## Aside: Dunlop

- Dunlop also own the MXR and Way Huge pedal brands
    - Way Huge was founded by Jeorge Tripps in LA originally. Their brand is
      "out there" pedals
- Dunlop makes a lot of stuff: picks, strings, capos, slides, instrument
  maintenance gear and consumables, cables, straps, Straplok strap buttons (they
  own the Straplok brand), fret wire, guitar electronics, pedal board patch
  cables

## Specific pedals

### BMF wah

- recommended by Colm https://www.bmfeffects.com/products/bmf-wah
- can buy different boards to give it diff voices

### Dunlop cry baby wah pedals

Very good comparison of the freq sweeps of various cry baby wahs:
https://lifestyle.jimdunlop.com/find-your-cry-baby-wah/

- GCB95
    - The vanilla one
- 95Q
    - https://www.jimdunlop.com/cry-baby-95q-wah/
    - an expanded version of the original
    - has +15dB volume boost via small black side knob
    - has Q control via small black side knob
    - has "auto return" switching which mechanically (with presumably a spring)
      returns the pedal to the heel position and turns off the wah when you
      release it
- Dime cry baby from hell
    - https://www.jimdunlop.com/dimebag-cry-baby-from-hell-wah/
    - very versatile
    - NZD 430 new

    - can select 6 ranges
    - has volume boost
    - Q selector to control Q width (quacky -> warm)
- MC-404 CAE
    - Has 2 inductors
        - yellow Fasel brand = higher freq range, lower Q (not as quacky)
            - more vintage sounding
        - red Fasel brand = lower freq range, higher Q (quackier)
    - built for a famous pedal rig builder

- 105Q Crybaby Bass Wah
    - suitable and popular for guitar too
    - has 16db boost
    - no inductor, uses a vintage envelope filter
        - envelope opens via foot control rather than how hard you play
        - auto engages when you move it
            - ?? how does it disengage
        - has a high Q
- CM95 Clyde McCoy
    - similar range to 95 but less Q
    - most vintage styled and aimed

## Ways of using wah pedal

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38ccazzUrqc (TPS)

### Wah placement

- Wah at very front of chain
    - most common
    - filters guitar signal only
    - usually where wah is put
    - your time based effects will operate on the wah filtered signal
    - your effects only gets the filtered signal from the wah
- Wah at end of chain
    - less common
    - your wah will filter all your effected signal (you will wah your signal
      with it's delay trails)
    - becomes a master filter
    - can do some cool effects in some contexts

It's worth trying placing wah in different places

Wah and Fuzz exception - Fuzz is often right at the very front just before wah

### 1. Rhythmical use (funk)

- Instead of tapping your foot along with the music, you tap the wah pedal
- sounds good with some overdrive
- give an extra percussive vibe to your playing
- used extensively on funk

### 2. Note expression

- Faux talk-box expression kind of thing
- Hammett and Satriani use this extensively
- lets the notes alternately either pop out or disappear
- helps you stand out over a rhythm sound

### 3. Cocked wah

- Notable users
    - Mick Ronson (Bowie's guitar player)
- Find a spot in the wah sweep and stick to it
- You can mimic this sound with a treble booster

:question: Can auto wah pedals do this?

### 4. (kinda) Screaming seagull effect

- If you wire your wah pedal the wrong way (guitar into output, input to amp),
  it turns into an oscillator
- It creates an incredibly loud "screaming seagull" like sound when you turn the
  volume up on the guitar
- Pink Floyd (Gilmore) used this
- Must be an unbuffered vintage style wah pedal - a wah with a buffer won't do
  this
- [JAM Seagulls](https://www.jampedals.com/seagull/) pedal gives you a
  controllable version of this

## Auto wah

- Auto-wah and envelope filters are similar but not the same.
    - Auto wah is a time controlled effect. Envelope filters are a volume
      controlled effect.
- An auto-wah automates the movement of the sweep on a standard wah pedal.
    - It can be fixed in place easily
    - The sweep can be made faster than you could conveniently do with your foot
- An envelope filter the sweep is controlled by the average amplitude of your
  guitar signal
    - Locking the sweep in place (like a cocked wah) is a feature available on
      some EF pedals but then the pedal is not operating as an EF
- auto-wah pedals
    - [Boss AW-3](https://www.boss.info/global/products/aw-3/)
    - [Flower Pedals Hosta Wah (discontinued)](https://flower-pedals.com/pages/discontinued-pedals)
        - has tap tempo
- can move the sweep faster than you could move your foot
- the best ones are typically analog

## Envelope filters

- Envelope filter is a sweepable filter (can be LP, HP, BP depending on pedal)
- it does sound very similar to a wah pedal
- The sweep is controlled by the intensity of the guitar signal
- A wah is a filter that you control the filter sweep with your foot
- An envelope filter is controlled by how hard you hit the string.
    - it reacts to your playing style
    - the louder you play the more "intense" the effect is
    - the amplitude envelope (or average signal level over time) of the incoming
      sound determines and changes the center point of the filter
    - Louder sounds move the center frequency higher, softer sounds move it
      lower
        - Some pedals have a "direction" toggle to invert this
    - Guitar output goes into envelope detector which controls an output voltage
      based on an average amplitude of the incoming signal
- used on bass a lot
- you place it just how you would place a wah
- Pedals
    - Mutron
        - the original envelope filter
        - currently available as a Mutron III
        - still highly recommended
    - EHX Q-Tron
        - Available in _Mini_ and _Nano_ sizes
    - [Source Audio Spectrum](https://www.sourceaudio.net/spectrum_intelligent_filter.html)
        - can also operate as an auto-wah (I think)
        - very feature rich, has an app to do setup
    - Analogman Envelope Filter
    - DOD 440
    - [Earthquaker Spatial Delivery](https://www.earthquakerdevices.com/spatial-delivery)
    - [EHX Riddle (discontinued)](https://www.ehx.com/products/riddle/)
    - [Wampler Terraform](https://www.wamplerpedals.com/products/modulation/terraform/)
        - technically a multi-fx board but can do Envelope filter
- Used extensively in funk playing
- Notable players
    - Bootsy Collins
- Notable songs
    - Stevie Wonder's Higher Ground
- Some pedals have both envelope filter and auto wah functionality
- Tip: Running a compressor **after** the EF is good because it evens out the
  volume and knocks down any very loud notes
