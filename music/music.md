## Overview

1. Pitch (aka note or tone)
	* the sound itself
	* 12 pitches in western music (within each octave)
    * pitches are organised into scales (a family of notes)
    * scales are the usual birthplaces of melody and harmony
    * melody = the part of music we can sing
    * harmony = two or more pitches at the same time
1. Rhythm
	* Palpably organised time
	* motion
1. Form
    * most music follows an A-B-A  form e.g. verse-chorus-verse, statement-departure-return
1. Tension and release
    * Building and releasing tension is an important facet of a musical piece

Piano Tips

* C is the white key to the left of two black keys, D is in the middle, E is on the right
* F is on the left of three black keys cluster, then B, then G and A is on the right

The distance from one interval to another is a called a _semitone_ or _half-step_

## Scales (also known as keys)

* a bunch of notes arranged in steps into a particular order that gives a sense of "home"
* the sense of "home" is called tonality
* tonality is a sort of "musical gravity"
* scale and key mean the same thing
* "what key is this in?" == "what scale does this use?"
* most (but not all) scales are a selection of 7 pitches from the available 12
    * any note within the 7 is said to be "diatonic" ie within the scale/key
* the "home note" of the scale is called the tonic/root/do (as in do-re-me...)/one of the scale

### Major scales

**All** major scales have the steps form:

    whole-whole-half-whole-whole-whole-half

This form is what makes a major scale

In C major this looks like:

          whole-whole-half-whole-whole-whole-half
    C     D     E    F     G     A     B     C

There is a major scale starting on each of the 12 pitches => 12 major scales
but 4 of the pitches have two names (# and b) so you could => 16 major scales
but 24 is the more usual way of counting

There is only one major scale for each pitch.
There are many minor scales but 3 are common:

1. Natural minor
2. Enharmonic minor
3. Melodic minor

So you could say there are 48 commonly used scales in music.

### minor scales

There is only one kind of major scale but many kinds of minor scale e.g. melodic minor

    2 1 2 2 2 2 1
    whole-half-whole-whole-whole-whole-half
    C     D     Eb    F     G     A     B     C

## Tuning

A 440hz

* 11 named pitches
	* 7 with one name
	* 4 with two possible names (flat or sharp)
* 12 pitches in an octave
* it is not the absolute frequencies tht matter - it is the intervals between the frequencies
* a melody is a sequence of **intervals**
* the intervals are subjective

So it's all about **intervals** and not much to do with absolute frequencies

* The octave is the most consonant interval and therefore the most important interval
* the interval of an octave is the most consonant (we perceive them as so close that they are the deeper or higher versions of the "same note") so we give them the same name
* so the system starts by finding octave intervals
* the math relationship between octaves are also clean - the frequencies double/halve

So we have the octave interval

* now we need to divide the octave up into smaller intervals based on how it sounds to our ears
* these divisions have names based on their distance from the octave frequencies
* all these divisions are defined as jumps from the "base" octave frequency
* the more consonant an interval sounds to human ears, the simpler the relationship between the two notes

?? what is a cent?

Remember we are just naming **intervals** here, not naming notes!

We want the intervals within the octave to be _more or less_ evenly spaced because it makes it much easier to move music up/down the frequency range (i.e. change key)

Layout of our interval names within an octave

    root m2 M2 m3 M3 P4 Tritone P5 m6 M6 m7 M7 8ve

Aside: Power chord = root + P5 or root + P5 + 8ve

How human ears perceive intervals, from most consonant to most dissonant:

    Octave (generally accepted) <most consonant>
    Perfect 5th/Perfect 4th (generally accepted)

    (people disagree with the order from here on)
    Major 3rd/Minor 6th
    Minor 3rd/Major 6th

    (things below here are considered dissonant)
    Major 2nd/Minor 7th
    Minor 2nd/Major 7th
    Tritone
    Microtonal intervals (quarter tone etc.) <most dissonant>

## Alternatives to 12 notes in octave

* examples
    * 24 notes per octave
    * 19 notes per octave
* -- much more complicated to play
* ++ moar notes!
* most people agree that the extra notes are not useful enough for the added complexity
* 12 notes in an octave is the commonly agreed upon compromise
* some composers have had a play
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Wyschnegradsky
        * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDroa5WTU34
    * microtonal guitars are a thing

Above we have shown "Just intonation" which tunes the instrument based on ratios

* if you use ratios to tune your instrument it works fine for one octave root but the ratios do not hold if you use one of your other intervals as the root
* => your music will sound good with one root but not in others
* => you cannot move your composition around
* you would have to re-tune your instrument to play in a different key

We fix this with "temperament" - we have to "temper" the intervals to make the tuning more versatile

Over history various "temperaments" have been used:

* Pythagorean
* Meantone
* Well temperament
* Equal temperament

Tempering is a compromise between keeping the intervals within an octave sounding good and being able to move around

The (almost) universally adopted modern system is _12 tone equal temperament_

## 12 tone equal temperament

12ET makes every interval equidistant

1. tune the octave with the perfect mathematical ratio
2. divide the octave into 12 equal intervals

12ET is technical slightly out of tune but we are so used to it that we don't really notice.

## FAQ

### Why 7 notes in a scale/key? why not a diff number?

Using the 7 letters mean the same 7 **letters** are used in every key - this is supposedly easier to understand than having to memorize which letters are skipped

Ancient greeks noticed:

* Doubling the length of a string gives a very harmonious outcome
* Tripling the length of a string gives a harmonious outcome
* Quadrupling the length of a string gives a very harmonious outcome

They thought in terms of string lengths, we know this maps directly to frequencies now.
They experimented with different length strings to produce different outcomes

They noticed that the ratios of 3/2 and 4/3 made for nice sounding output
This later solidified into the major triad

Together 3/2 and 4/3 divide up the octave

Why is C the "starting point"

> Notes do not "start" with C; C major is just the easiest major key to notate
> in modern notation. The concept of a major key came about long after letters
> were assigned to the notes. Before there were major (and minor) keys, people
> used modes, usually just using the notes of the modern white keys and starting
> and ending in different places. The Ionian mode (which became modern major) was
> a late addition to the modes.
>
> So it's historical accident that C major is treated as "basic."
