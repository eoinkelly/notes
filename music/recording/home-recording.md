Direct input boxes

* Types of DI box
	* Passive
		* just passes signal
	* Active
		* needs phantom power
		* can add gain
		* typically has more options
* They are uses as a Y splitter
	* input from instrument
	* there is a "through" output that you send to your amp
	* there is an XLR output that you send to your interface
	* lets you listen to the amp and record the DI at the same time.
		* then you can re-amp the DI signal later

? does it get powered via phantom power from the XLR?
