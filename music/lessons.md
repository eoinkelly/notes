## Structure of music practice

There are 3 parts to music practice

1. maintenance (fitness)
    - practice stuff you already know
    - scales, patterns, chords
2. New material -New scales, techniques, chords, songs etc.
3. Fun/Jamming
    - playing songs you already know

My practice should include all these

## Structure of music

3 important parts to music:

1. Melody
    - single notes
2. Harmony
    - 2 or more notes (chords = 3 or more)
    - can be an interaction between instruments playing a single note
3. Rhythm
    - always be thinking of the box
    - have the beat in your head
    - improvised notes should start and end somewhere on a 1/4 1/8 1/16 of a bar
    - ideally i can hear the time tick in my head and know when to start stop

## Specific things to practice

- 1 note from a a scale, improvise over metronome or chords
- 2 note from a a scale, improvise over metronome or chords
- 3 note from a a scale, improvise over metronome or chords
- ... and so on adding notes

- learn the notes on the neck
- memorise the notes in some scales
    - together with knowing the notes on the neck this frees me up from specific
      patterns
- try "flash card" approach of picking note at random and figuring it out
- landmarks
    - 5th fret is always the same as the open string below it (4th in case of G
      string)
- use whole, half as words for scale intervals - there are already multiple sets
  of numbers in the mix so 1,2 isn't as clear
- practice using strict alternate picking for scales

### Scale sequences

create patterns within a scale to practice

```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 (1)


Go up in 3's
1 2 3
2 3 4
3 4 5
4 5 6
5 6 7
6 7 8

8 7 6
7 6 5
6 5 4
5 4 3
4 3 2
3 2 1

Go up and down in 4's

1 2 3 4
2 3 4 5
etc.

Go up
1 3
2 4
3 5
4 6
etc.

Go up in 5ths
1 5
2 6
3 7
4 8
5 8+1
etc.

Create similary patterns to learn
Any pattern is valid
```

These practice

- finger dexterity
- getting soloing way from up/down scales
