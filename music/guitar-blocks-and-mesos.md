# 2025 Guitar Block 1 (12 weeks - Mon 6 Jan - Sun 30 Mar)

## 2025 B1 M1 (4 weeks - Mon 6 Jan - Sun 2 Feb)

### Goal

The goal here is to prepare to do the Cory Wong Workshop 1

-   Learn the fretboard
    -   Given a note name, be able to quickly (without calculating) find all its locations between
        1st and 12th fret
    -   Given a location between 1-12 frets, be able to quickly (without calculating) name the note
        there
    -   Given a chord shape, be able to quickly identify all the notes in the shape
    -   Given a scale , be able to quickly play that scale on each string using the full range of
        the string
        -   be able to play it vertically too
-   Do some time practicing with drone

-   I want to practice every day but I have 3 "skip days" each week I can use.
-   Skip days don't roll over to next week.
-   Each practice is 30m but can extend as much as I want.
-   Practice is separate from noodling, playing/learning songs or exploratory learning

TODO: is doing CAGED AND 3n/s at same time too much to memorise?

### Daily schedule

```
5m one of the fretonomy circle of fifths games  ("Circle Name note", "Circle Find note")

5m spider walks from Wong workshop 1
    - use metronome, try to get fast at this, don't go too fast yet tho

3m stretches

5m "first fretted instance of note on each string forwards and backwards" moving notes via circle of fourths
    - use metronome, try to get fast at this

5m one of the fretonomy "find note on fretboard" games ("Name note", "Find note")

15m CAGED exercise
    (Start at root, say notes as I go, use metronome)
    For each note (start C, go in circle 4ths order)
        Play drone from that note
        for each of the 5 shapes
            1. play the chord
            2. arpeggiate the chord, naming each note as I play it
            3. play all the available 1-3-5 triads in the chord shape
        for each of the 5 shapes
            1. play the major scale (use scale practice tips below)
        for each of the 5 shapes
            1. play the pentatonic scale (use scale practice tips below)

15m 3n/s major scale exercise
    (Start at root, say notes as I go, use metronome)
    For each note (start C, go in circle 4ths order)
        for each of the 7 shapes
            1. play the major scale (use scale practice tips below)
        for each of the 7 shapes
            1. play the pentatonic variation scale (use scale practice tips below)

7m noodle time!

Total duration = 60m
```

## 2025 B1 M2 (4 weeks)

BLOCKED UNTIL MESO 1 DONE

## 2025 B1 M3 (4 weeks)

BLOCKED UNTIL MESO 1 DONE

# Notes

```
Scales:

major scale - 7 x 3n/s shapes

Pre-requesites I need to do Practice A:
1. know circle 4ths enough to know what note to choose next
1. memorise the CAGED scale boxes (that's a goal separate to just practicing/refreshing them)
1. memorise the 7 3n/s major scale shapes

In common notation:
# the "X7" notation implies m7. Technically this is also "Cdominant7" but that
# notation not used
C7      = C-E-G-Bb    = R-M3-P5-m7
Cmaj7   = C-E-G-B     = R-M3-P5-M7

CAGED

G shape
    contains the backwards single octave shape starting at 6th
    contains 1oct straight-down starting at 4th string shape
C shape
    contains the backwards 1 octave shape starting at 5th
A shape
    contains 1oct straight-down starting at 5th string shape
E shape
    contains the backwards 1 octave shape starting at 4th
    contains 1oct straight-down starting at 6th string shape
D shape
    contains 1oct straight-down starting at 4th string shape


The "forward 1oct shapes are not in caged but are in the 3n/s shapes
##########################

Overall there are 12 shapes of the major scale that I should learn (CAGED = 5, 3n/s = 7)

##########################
Question: The "5 pentatonic shapes are just the CAGED shapes cut down?

C = Pattern 3
A = Pattern 4
G = Pattern 5
E = Pattern 1
D = Pattern 2

pattern numbers are based on which note of the scale they hang from
=> knowing the CAGED shapes means I also practice the pentatonic shapes
##########################
```

### Tip: How to practice a scale

-   use a metronome
-   start on a root note. for full range scales, go down and back up to the root at the end so all
    notes get played but the root is emphasised
-   say each note as I play it

TODO: Each scale has

-   7 notes
-   1 x step pattern
-   1 x intervals pattern
-   many shapes on the fretboard

Q: If I know all the notes on the fretboard well and I know the scale notes then do I need the
patterns?

### Cory Wong Guitar Course - Pre-requisites

1. Note location
    - Go fwd and bkwd through circle of 5ths finding the first available note is on each string
    - try to get to it at a fast pace and with a metronome
2. Circle of 4ths and 5ths
3. Major vs minor triads
4. Relative major to relative minor
5. CAGED system

    - each note has 5 shapes
    - each shape is an 4-5 fret chunk of the fretboard. taken together it lets you play the
      chord/triads/scales of that note in 5 locations on the neck
    - each one is a reference point for your brain
    - each shape has
        1. chord shape
        1. a set of triads within the chord shape (3 note chord options which have all the required
           parts of the chord)
            - C shape = 4 triads (6-4, 5-3, 4-2, 3-1)
            - A shape =
            - D shape = 1 triad (3-1), 4-2 has 1,5 but no 3 (has G,D but no B)
        1. major scale shape
        1. pentatonic scale shape
            - just a cut down version of the major scale shape

```
### Major and relative minors

TODO: review this in the video. I have enough to do in meso 1 so ignore this for now.

Wong and Trucks use 2 x Fender super reverb cabs as backline Trucks thinks it's the 10" speakers and
maybe the 2ohm impedance (dubious to me but wtf am I to disagree with Derek Trucks)( Trucks doesn't
use pedals

```

#### Relative minor

For your minor keys, you just need to remember that the 6th scale degree of every major scale is its
relative minor scale. Scale degree 6 in C major is A, so C major's relative minor is A minor. Scale
degree 6 of A♭ major is F, therefore A♭ major's relative minor is F minor.

#### Interval memorisation

One thing you can do is go through any music you are working on, and simply calculate each and every
interval in that music. This is especially easy (but totally effective) if you READ the music. You
can take sheet music in with you when you are taking a morning dump, or on your bus commute, or
whatever. Read the music and calculate every interval, both harmonic and melodic.

Get used to thinking in terms of intervals. Think of all the intervals in various scales. For
instance, think of the intervals that exist in major and minor, or in the various modes. Like this:

Major:

Unison, maj2, maj3, p4, p5, maj6, maj7, octave (maj9) (maj10) etc

Minor (natural): uni, maj2, min3, p4, p5, min6, min7, oct

Phrygian: uni, min2, min3, p4, p5, min6, min7, oct

Etc.

Do the same with all your chord types:

Maj7: uni, maj3, p5, maj7

Min9: uni, min3, p5, min7, maj9

Dom9: uni, maj3, p5, min7, maj9

And so on.

Learn the same for triads in all inversions:

Maj 1st inversion: uni - min3, min6

Maj 2nd inv: uni - p4, maj6

Etc.

Just think about it and use it all the time. Eventually you just KNOW what intervals are, and don't
even have to think about it.

It's no different than learning to read, for example, where you had to sound every word out to be
able to read it. Now you just read in an effortless way.

It just gets easier and easier.
