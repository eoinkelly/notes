The four types of audio plugin formats are:

AU: Ableton Live, Logic Pro
AAX: Pro Tools 10 and later
RTAS: Pro Tools 10 and earlier

Each of these plugin formats can come in different versions, so you may see mentions of VST2, VST3, AU2, etc.
Most paid plugins come in multiple formats
Sometimes the "lite" versions of DAWs do not let you use plugins
