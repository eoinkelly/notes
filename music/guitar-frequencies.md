# Guitar frequency ranges

In-tune electric guitar covers the range from about 80 Hz to about 1200 Hz (Figure 3.8).


## A take

* Lows (0 - 200HZ) - Most clean electric guitars can have their low-end swept out up to about 150 Hz. There is a valuable amount of body and fullness between 150 and 250 Hz, so try not to sweep too much of the low-end.
* Lower Mids (200 Hz - 1kHz) - Clean electric guitars carry a large portion of the character in this region, particularly between 300 and 800 Hz. Much like the acoustic guitar, frequencies in this area need to be carefully attenuated to remove any mud and preserve tonal definition.
* Upper Mids (1 - 5kHz)- Electric guitars can often carry a fair amount of clutter in this region, especially between 1 and 2.5 kHz. This clutter can give electric guitars an unpleasant honky overtone. Search around in this region for any harsh frequencies and reduce them accordingly.
* Highs (5 kHz and above)- Certain areas in this region can be raised to add brilliance or sparkle to your electric guitar. However, guitars can also become overly shrill and harsh in the high-end, so be sure not to boost too much in this area.

## Another take

* Lows (0 - 200HZ)- Most of the low-end in this region can be swept off to create room for other instruments like a bass guitar. A lot of the fundamental thickness of distorted electric guitars sits between 150 and 250 kHz, so shape this area with a close and caring ear.
* Lower Mids (200 Hz - 1kHz)- Distortion can introduce a considerable amount of mud in the lower mids. Be sure to search for areas in this region that can be reduced to clean up this mud so that your low-end is clear and defined.
* Upper Mids (1 - 5kHz)- Much like a clean electric guitar, it's healthy to search for areas in this region that generate too much harshness or honk on your guitar tone. This usually resides between 1 and 3 kHz with distorted electric guitar.
* Highs (5 kHz and above) - You can use a low-pass filter to sweep out a lot of redundant noise down to around 20 kHz, which should help add some presence to your electric guitar. Search for areas between 3 and 5-kHz that may need enhancing to add some clarity to your high-end.

## Table of Bass Frequencies

```
Fundamentals	Harmonics   To
4-string Bass	41Hz-392Hz	~4kHz-5kHz
5-string Bass	31Hz-392Hz	~4kHz-5kHz
6-string Bass	31Hz-523Hz	~4kHz-5kHz
```

Here's an easy way you can remember the basic frequency range of the bass: 40Hz-400Hz-4000Hz.

The fundamentals range from about 40 to 400 Hertz; the harmonics go all the way to 4000Hz. Simple!
