## Jargon

* Two names are _enharmonic_ if they are aliases for the same note.
* Every musical scale has 7 _degrees_.
    * scales have 8 notes including the octave. So 7 unique notes.
    * each unique note in the scale is called a "degree" (I think)
    * The numbering starts at 1.
    * Degree 8 is the same as the octave
    * The distance in semitones between each degree varies and is what gives the scale it's character

### Interval names within a major scale (true any major scale)

* NB: These are all **intervals** i.e. distances between notes
* The primary names below are derived from the major scale
* The natural state of the intervals is the major scale are the "major intervals".
  * The minor intervals are maybe a sort of "fill in the gaps" naming in this case?

| Num half steps | Degree | Degree name  | Primary Name(s)                    | Aliases            |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| 0              | 1      | Tonic        | Perfect unison                     | Diminished second  |
| 1              |        |              | Minor second                       |                    |

| 6              |        |              | Augmented fourth, Diminished fifth |                    |
| 7              | 5      | Dominant     | Perfect fifth                      | Diminished sixth   |

Rules around augmented and diminished **intervals** ("notes" are not augmented or diminished, **intervals** are)

* When you raise a **perfect** interval by a half-step it is called augmented
* When you lower a **perfect** interval by a half-step it is called diminished
* When you raise a **major** interval by a half-step it is called augmented
* When you lower a **minor** interval by a half-step it is called diminished
* you cannot create an augmented interval by raising a minor interval
    * Q: Why?
* Note that you cannot create an diminished interval by lowering a major interval
    * Q: Why? Just too many names?

## 3: Scales

What is a scale?

* A scale is 8 successive pitches within a one octave range
* Always ends on the same note as the first note but one octave higher
* Each scale has 8 _degrees_
* Different types of scale have different distances between their degrees. These different intervals are what makes the scales different
* If you play notes which are part of the scale they are _diatonic_. If you play notes outside the scale they are _chromatic_ (chroma = color => chromatic notes add color to a piece)
* There is one major scale and multiple minor scales for each note
* Major is written with an 'M' and minor is written with an 'm'
* A scale is defined by
    1. its first degree/tonic note
    2. it's interval pattern
* Baed on their interval patterns, scales are grouped into categores such as major, minor, chromatic etc.

### Chromatic scale

A _chromatic_ scale includes all the notes within one octave (including sharps and flats)

    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    half half half half half half half half half half half

### Major scale

A Major scale is defined by it's intervals:

    2 2 1 2 2 2 1
    2 2 1    2    2 2 1 (Ancient greek view: 2x tetrachords joined by a whole step interval, called Ionian mode)
    whole whole half whole whole whole half

On a piano, the C Major scale _happens_ to be just white keys but **all other
major scales have black keys in them** i.e major scales are not "white key
scales", it just happens to be the case on that on instrument (Piano) for that
one Major scale (C Major)

Scales can be enharmonic too e.g. C# Major is enharmonic to Db Major

### Minor scales (3 related patterns)

3 kinds or minor scale for each note:

1. Natural
2. Harmonic
3. Melodic

### Natural minor

    2 1 2 2 1 2 2
    whole half whole whole half whole whole

* Is just a major scale shifted
    * starts on the 6th degree of it's relative/corresponding major scale
    * up 9 half-steps or down 3 half-steps
    * up 5 degrees or down 2 degrees
* has exactly the same 8 notes as it's corresponding Major scale

### Harmonic minor

    2 1 2 2 1 3 1
    whole half whole whole half three whole

* A variation on the natural minor
* Nice to play, awkward to sing. Hence the melodic minor
* is a common foundation for chords (harmonies) in minor keys


Q: were scales invented or discovered?

### Melodic minor

    2 1 2 2 2 2 1
    whole half whole whole whole whole half

* Some (but not all) music theorists use melodic minor when going up a scale but use the natural minor notes when going down.

## Modes

Q: are they combinations of notes not represented by the combo of major + minors + modes?


* Once you get past the major and minor scales, all the other 8 note combinations are called **modes** instead of scales.
* we think of modes are related to a major scale but in practice they are their own set of intervals
* modes give a different twist on the major scale - you get a different feel while staying within the same notes of the traditional major scale
* Modes pre-date scales by a lot (modes date to ancient greece):
    * Major scale is based on the Ionian mode.
    * Minor scale based on the Aeolian mode
* The number and use of modes expanded in the era of the medieval church - these were called _church modes_

### 7 essential modes

* The 7 essential modes are rotations of the major scale intervals
* each one starts on a different degree of the major scale but uses the same notes as it's major scale


| Mode name  | Starting degree | Intervals     | Notes                                                  |
| ---------- | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Ionian     | 1               | 2 2 1  2  2 2 1 | **exactly** the major scale                            |
| Dorian     | 2               | 2 1 2  2  2 1 2 | pretty close to natural minor                          |
| Phrygian   | 3               | 1 2 2  2  1 2 2 | pretty close to natural minor                          |
| Lydian     | 4               | 2 2 2  1  2 2 1 | major ish sounding                                     |
| Mixolydian | 5               | 2 2 1  2  2 1 2 | also major ish sounding                                |
| Aeolian    | 6               | 2 1 2  2  2 1 2 | **exactly** the natural minor scale                    |
| Locrian    | 7               | 1 2 2  2  1 2 2 | sounds unusual, unused for centuries, used in Jazz now |


## Keys

* Writing the sharp/flat symbol for every note would be annoying to write and to read
* So the idea of a "key" was invented to set a default in terms of what should be sharp and flat for a piece
* Each key corresponds to a scale.
* When you assign a key to apiece then people assume most of the notes will stay within that scale and you only have to annotate the exceptions.
* The exceptions are called "accidentals", a name which makes more sense in this context than in the "general name for sharps and flats" context

### Key signatures

* You specify a key by setting a "key signature" at the very start of a piece.
* The key signature specifies which sharps and flats to use for the whole piece

* There is a key for each scale
* There are 15 major scales (including 3 enharmonics) so there are 15 major keys
* Natural minor scales are rotations of the major scales so they share the same key signature as their corresponding major scale because they include the same notes

### Reading key signatures

* Single flat => Key of F
* Multiple flats => Look at the next-to-last flat to get the key
* look at last sharp, next note up is the key
    * last sharp in th key signature represents the 7th degree of that particular scale so the tonic of the scale is the next note up


### Aside: Types of scale

| Name       | Notes per octave |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| Chromatic  | 12               |
| Nonatonic  | 9                |
| Octatonic  | 8                |
| Heptatonic | 7                |
| Hexatonic  | 6                |
| Pentatonic | 5                |
| Tetratonic | 4                |
| Tritonic   | 3                |
| Ditonic    | 2                |

    Q: why no 10 and 11?

Wikipedia describes scales as "being explored" in 19th and 20th century. I guess you just find a combo of notes that sounds good to you and other people and then you have a scale?

### Aside: blue notes

Bends make "blue notes", notes which are not exactly on a semitone, come from jazz and blues
