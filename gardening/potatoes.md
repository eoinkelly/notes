# Growing potatoes

    (have not implemented these notes yet, so far this is just a summary of youtube videos :-)

- usually takea about 12 weeks from planting to harvest
- you want very good drainage in the soil to prevent the spuds from rotting
    - this is why some people start the potato drill as a mound (which then
      grows as you hill the potatoes)

# Rotating growing sites

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijWYOe5bp_o&nohtml5=False
    - recommends sulphur as a fungcide, insecticide
    - recommend rotating potato planting sites on a 3 year basis (so you need 3
      sites if you want spuds every year)
    - spuds from supermarket are often sparyed with anti-sprouting agent

## Planting

1. dig trench 1 spade wide, 6 inches deep
1. optional: put layer of lime down to prevent slugs getting at the spuds
1. put layer of good compost or mulch down
    - some seem to use bought compost, some dried cow shit
1. wate the layer of mulch/compost
1. use some method to ensure the spuds are evenly spaced (marks on a piece of
   wood seems popular)
1. use something to poke a small hole in the compost (trowel, or broken spade
   end) and plant the seed potato with sprouts upward
1. rake the earth you dug out of the trench back in

## Hilling

- start hilling 5 ish weeks after planting and then every few weeks after that
- do not _fully_ cover the plants - leave a few leaves visible
- seen advice to water the soil well before hilling if there hasn't been recent
  rain

## Harvesting

- when they finish flowering you _can_ harvest but most of the potatoes will be
  small
    - potoatoes will have soft skins now
- ideally wait 2/3 weeks after the foliage has died back (looks brown and edad)
    - potatos will have developed tougher skins by now but will be larger
- dig them and let them dry
    - don't wash them until you are ready to use them
- do not store potatos with things that emit ethelyene gas (e.g. apples,
  bananas) as it will cause them to spoil

you know when they are ready to harvest because they start to flower but if you
leave them in the ground after that they will swell up
