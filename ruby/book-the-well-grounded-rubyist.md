# The well grounded rubyist

Think of ruby as 3 levels of stuff

1. core language
2. extenstions & libraries that _ship with_ ruby (and the facility for making
   your own).
3. command line tools that _ship with_ ruby.

# Ruby identifiers

Thinking like a parser for a moment, _every_ element in ruby source code is one
of four types of _identifier_.

1. Variables (4 types)
    1. Local
    2. Instance
    3. Class
    4. Global
2. Constants
3. Keywords
4. Method names

In more detail:

1. Variables (4 types)
    1. Local
        - start with letter, \_
        - contain: letters, \_, digits
        - e.g. `some_var`
    2. Instance
        - start with @
        - otherwise same rules as local vars
        - e.g. `@some_var`
    3. Class
        - start with @@
        - otherwise same rules as local vars
        - e.g. `@@some_var`
    4. Global
        - start with `$`
        - can contain a bunch of special characters (unlike local, instance,
          class variables)
        - if it begins with a `$` its a global!
        - e.g. $LOAD_PATH, $:, $1, $/
2. Constants
    - begin with uppercase letter
    - e.g. `Foo`, `FOO_BAR`, `STDIN`
3. Keywords
    - e.g. `def`, `class`, `if`
    - approx 40 keywords in Ruby
4. Method names
    - same naming rules as local variable except they can _end in_ `!`, `?`, `=`
    - each of the extra naming suffixes has a meaning (by convention, not
      enforced by ruby)
        - `!` this method is dangerous
        - `?` this method returns true|false (is a predicate)
        - `=` this method is a setter for an instance variable
    - Ruby does enforce `!?=` being at the **end** of the method name e.g.
      `def foo?bar; puts "blah"; end` will create _#foo?_ that takes one arg

Constructors in ruby can either be Foo.new(...) or some built-in objects have
special syntax

```ruby
# Object constructors with special syntax:

"stringy" # String constructor
23        # Fixnum constructor
[3,5,6]   # Array constructor
{a: 4}    # Hash constructor
4.5       # Float constructor
:foo      # Symbol constructor

# others ???
```

There is a difference between sending a message and the method that implements
it. In most case they are the same but with stuff like `method_missing` there is
no garuantee that the message name will match the method name.

The book says:

> some syntatic structures that help you create and manipulate objects are not
> themselves objects

Some examples of these syntactic structures:

- blocks are not strictly object (but can be converted into objects)
- argument list - contains object but is not an object itself
- keywords e.g. if, else

**Everything in ruby does _evaluate_ to a single object!**

This is true not only of variables, object literals, and method calls, but of
control-flow structures, keyword-based statements, class and method definitions,
and everything else.

```ruby
# Empty class delcaration evaluates to nil
class Foo; end          # => nil

# but actually class declarations evaluate to whatever their last expression returns
class Bar; 4 + 5; end   # => 9

# ... so we can use this to get hold of the singleton class for the class
class Bar2; self; end   # => Bar2

# of course using #singleton_class is easier
Bar.singleton_class

# conditionals always evaluate to whatever object is returned by the last line of the
# section that executed. They evaluate to nil if no case matched

[1] pry(main)> if (true); "hi"; else; "bah"; end
"hi"
[2] pry(main)> if (false); "hi"; else; "bah"; end
"bah"
[3] pry(main)> if (false); "hi"; else; "bah"; 23; end
23
[4] pry(main)> if (false); "no"; end
nil

# same goes for case statements

[5] pry(main)> case "hi"; when "hi"; 23; 24; end
24
[6] pry(main)> case "hix"; when "hi"; 23; 24; end
nil
```

Bareword method calls (without an explicit receiver) use `self` as the receiver.
Within a class `self` is a reference to the class. At the global level `self` is
a refernce to the _default object_.

```ruby
>> puts "hi"
# is really just ...
>> self.puts "hi"

>> self
main
>> self.class
Object < BasicObject
```

- Objects can get methods and behaviours that their class did not give them in
  two ways
    1. Re-open the object and add stuff to its singleton class (eigenclass).
       There are two syntaxes for this:
        1. `def ob_name.method_name`
        2. `class << ob_name`
    2. Refinements QUESTION: do refinements add stuff to the singleton class
       too?
- The class is responsibile for the object being born in memory (instantiation)
  but once there, the object has a life of its own. This is a defining principle
  of ruby code!

```ruby
class Foo
end

f1 = Foo.new
f2 = Foo.new

# Method 1: def ob.meth_name
############################

# add a method to f1 singleton class
def f1.thing
  puts "hi from thing"
end

# Method 2: <<
##############

class << f1
  # create new lexical scope, methods in here go in f1's singleton class
  def do_other_thing
    puts "other thing"
  end
end

# Method 3: Refinements
#######################

# Foo will have an extra method when this refinement is invoked
module SomeThing
  refine Foo do
    def local_thing
      puts "local thing"
    end
  end
end


# Usage
#######

f1.thing # => "hi from thing"
f2.thing # NoMethodError

f3 = Foo.new

f3.local_thing # NoMethodError

using SomeThing

f3.local_thing # => "local thing"
```

## # Checking syntax

Syntastic ruby checking uses `'-w -T1 -c` as args

- `-c` check syntax
- `-w` show warnings
- `-T1` run in $SAFE level 1 (turn on tainting checks)

# Taint & Trust

- Ruby considers user input tainted by default
- You can mark objects as `tainted` in ruby
- Use the _#taint_ and _#untaint_ methods to control taintedness
- _#tainted?_ checks the taintedness status of an object

```
1] pry(main)> str = gets
Hi there
"Hi there\n"
[2] pry(main)> str.tainted?
true
[3] pry(main)> str2 = "foo"
"foo"
[4] pry(main)> str2.tainted?
false
```

Ruby 1.9+ also has the notion of objects being trusted

_#trust_ _#untrust_ _#trusted?_

#### $SAFE

All information from the outside world can be marked as tainted. When running in
a safe mode, potentially dangerous methods will raise a SecurityError if passed
a tainted object.

- Ruby has differnt levels of paranoia you can access by setting `$SAFE`

more at http://phrogz.net/programmingruby/taint.html

Rails apps work almost exclusively with tainted data so they don't use the taint
and trust mechanisms provided by ruby. Similarly running a rails app with $SAFE
set to a high level would probably stop it functioning.

### ruby config

- `RbConfig::CONFIG` is a big hash of the ruby interpreters config variables
- it seems to always be available in my irb/pry

- rubylibdir
    - contains the std lib (ruby files)
- archdir
    - runtime loadable C extensions (.so, .dll, .bundle)
- sitedir
    - a local parallel of the main ruby installation dir for your custom stuff
    - has its own archdir and libdir (`sitearchdir` and `sitelibdir`)
- vendordir
    - some third party stuff installs itself here
    - it is not yet clear whether it is best practice to install to here or
      sitedir

Where does ruby code I use live?

1. within _ruby_ binary.
2. as an _extension_ loaded at runtime.

Where do extensions live?

1. In the standard library that ships with ruby
2. In bundles of code that I install (gems)
3. In my app

What language are extensions written in?

Extensions can be written in ruby or compiled native code (which can be any
language). _ruby_ (the binary) talks to compiled code through its _ffi_

TODO: find out more of details of ruby ffi? is it C only?

Terminology

- _feature_ is most general term (covers extensions and libraries)
- _extension_ implies it is written in C
- _library_ is a common term for ruby code loaded at runtime

How can I load code at runtime in ruby?

2. `load`
1. `require`
1. `require_relative`
1. `gem` ???

# load vs require

## precursor: unix cwd

- Every unix process has a "current working directory"
- It is stored in the process by the Kernel
- If the process was spawned from a shell it will usually be set to whatever the
  CWD of the shell was.
- System calls like `chdir` and `getcwd` use this if you don't pass them an
  absolute path
- Shell built-ins like `pwd` and `cd` use it too

You can inspect the cwd of a process using

```shell
$ pgrep someprocessname
12345
lsof -p 12345| grep cwd
```

`Dir.pwd`

- prints the process' current working directory as a string

`Dir.chdir`

- Changes the current working directory **of the process** to the given string
- You can pass it a block which will change the dir for the block only (changes
  it back after the block ends - neat!

`$:` or `$LOAD_PATH` _ Array of dirs that ruby will search for filenames passed
to `load` _ `.` is not on the load path. `load` is hardwired to search it first
anyway

## load

Load basically reads a file into a string and evals it. It is also smart enough
to look for the file in entries on the `$LOAD_PATH` and can wrap the contents of
the string in an anonymous module for you to provide _some_ protection from it.

There is no "units of code" like other langs have - there is just text in files
that is evaluated.

```
load "foo.rb"

# roughly equivalent to ...

eval File.read("foo.rb")
```

- Signature: `load(FILENAME, wrap=false) # -> true`
- simpler than require - it _loads a file_ but require _requires a feature_
- `load` lives in `Kernel`
- _FILENAME_ is one of
    1. filename with extension: e.g. `foo.rb`
        - `load` will search for the file in
            1. The _current working dir_ of the process. Note this is probably
               not the directory that the including file is in!
            2. Each directory in global `$:` (`$LOAD_PATH`) array.
                - Note that the CWD of the process is _not_ on `$LOAD_PATH` by
                  default
    2. relative path
        - is assumed to be relative to the current working directory of the
          process (which can change)
        - it will **not** search $LOAD_PATH in this case
    3. absolute path
        - e.g. `/var/thing/foo.rb`
        - it will **not** search $LOAD_PATH in this case
- Notice
    - you don't have to manually add CWD to the `$LOAD_PATH` with `load`
    - the only time it will search `$LOAD_PATH` if you give it a _filename_!
    - _filename_ must have the `.rb` suffix - load does no magic here.
    - it looks for the file _directly_ in the dirs of `$LOAD_PATH` - it does not
      care about specific subdirectories
- `load` is a method so will be executed at the point where ruby finds it in my
  file. Implications:
    - you can skip loads by putting them in conditionals
    - you can generate the filename argument dynamically
- load will not check to see if the file has been loaded already
    - sometimes this is very handy (e.g. playing with a file in _irb_) but most
      of the time it is not what you want.

### optional wrapping

```ruby
# ./loadee.rb
local_var= 12
def local_method; 23; end
LocalConst = 34
class SomeClassName; end
::NASTY = 'hi'
$globally = "everywhere"


# ./loader_default.rb
load "loadee.rb"

# puts local_var        # hidden
# puts LocalConst       # hidden
# puts local_method     # leaks
# puts SomeClassName    # leaks because class names are attached to Object
# puts NASTY            # leaks because we explicitly attached the constant to Object
# puts $globally        # leaks because it is global

# ./loader_wrapped.rb
load("loadee.rb", true)

puts local_var        # hidden
puts local_method     # hidden
puts LocalConst       # hidden
puts SomeClassName    # hidden
puts NASTY            # leaks
puts $globally        # leaks
```

If the optional wrap parameter is true, the loaded script will be executed
within an anonymous module, _somewhat_ protecting the calling program's global
namespace.

Hides _ Constants _ local variables Does not hide _ class names _ method names _
Constants created with `::SomeConstant` _ `$global_variables`

There are a bunch of other ways that the loaded script can changed the global
environment so if you need real isolation you can

1. start a subprocess
2. use "fork and exec"

    TODO: what is diff between these?

Wrapped load does an `Module.new.instance_eval` so `self` within it will point
at the anonymous module which is thrown away and normal load just does a file
read and eval so it will share semantics with `eval`

#### Aside: eval

    TODO

#### Aside binding

Objects of class `Binding` encapsulate an _execution context_ at some place in
the code and store this context so you can use it again in future.

Things that are in an _execution context_:

- variables
- methods
- value of self
- an iterator block

- `Kernel#binding` will return a new binding that wraps up whatever execution
  context you are in when you called it.
- Instances of `Binding` can be passed as a second arg to `eval` to establish an
  environment for evaluation

Pry adds a `pry` method to all bindings and when you invoke `binding.pry` you
are calling it on the current execution context

#### Aside:

When you create a constant in global scope in ruby it is added to `Object` - it
is **not** added to the main object (which is what `self` refers to in the
global scope in Ruby)

```
[21] pry(main)> Eoin = "hi"
"hi"
[22] pry(main)> self
main
[23] pry(main)> self.constants
NoMethodError: undefined method `constants' for main:Object
[25] pry(main)> Object.constants.grep(:Eoin)
[
  [0] :Eoin
]

```

## Aside: running command from specific gem

- rubygems will check the command you run for the first arg
- if first arg is wrapped in `_` e.g. `_1.2.3_` it will steal it and run the
  command from that specific version of the gem

## require

- Protects you from loading files more than once this can cause bugs depending
  on what the files do

- require keeps a global list of all the files it has evaluated already:
  $LOADED_FEATURES
    - an array of fully qualified filenames of every file that has been required
        - is acutally a hash in MRI C land (so lookups are fast) but appears in
          ruby land as a hash
    - it uses absolute filename paths so that it won't be fooled by different
      strings
    ```
    # same file, different strings passed to require
    require "./foo"
    require "/Users/joe/code/foo"
    require "foo"
    ```

```
# This is how variables are shared between files using 'require'
# ./a.rb
a_local = "a local"
$a_blobal  = "a global"
class AClassName; end
A_CONSTANT = "a constant"
def a_local_method; "a local method"; end


# ./b.rb
require "./a"
# puts a_local # does not work
puts $a_blobal # works
puts AClassName # works
puts A_CONSTANT # works
puts a_local_method # works
```

- require works with "features" as opposed to files to allow it to work with
  dynamic libraries - the idea si that the if I am using a gem I shouldn't know
  whether it is implemented as a ruby file or as a C dylib

- require takes a "feature name" not a "file name"
- it then tries to resolve the "feature name" to a "file" - this file could be
  ruby, C etc.
- require returns true if it actually did the load, false if it was already
  loaded

- `require(name) # -> true (or false if name is already loaded)`
    - can be called many times but will only load its argument the first time
    - it is more abstract than `load` - you _require_ a _feature_ not a _file_
    - if name does not "resolve to an absolute path" then $LOAD_PATH will be
      searched.
        ```
        require "foo" # will not load ./foo.rb
        require "./foo" # will load ./foo.rb
        ```
    - if `require` gets just a feature name it only searches the `$LOAD_PATH`
    - if `require` gets a relative or absolute path then it converts it to an
      absolute path and loads the feature from it
        - QUESTION: will it alos search load path if you give it a "pathish"
          string?
    - file name extensions
        - you can require
            1. ruby files `require "foo.rb"
            2. C code `require "foo.so"`
        - if name ends in rb it is loaded as a ruby file
        - if it ends in .so|.dll|.o it is loaded as a ruby extension
        - you can use any extension filename (.so|.dll|.bundle|.o) and ruby will
          load the right one for your platform
        - it name does not have an extension, ruby tries adding .rb|.so etc.
          until it finds it
    - require throws a `LoadError` if it fails to find the feature
    - The absolute path of the feature is added to `$LOADED_FEATURES` (alias
      `$"`) - this is how require keeps track of what is loaded
    - in a rails app there are 2000+ entries in $LOADED_FEATURES

Notice that `require` looks for the feature _directly_ in the dirs on
`$LOAD_PATH` - it does not search sub directories or have any knowledge about
the directory structure.

#### How does `require` not load the same code twice?

It uses `$LOADED_FEATURES` to keep track.

### require_relative

- its big feature is that it will start the search in the directory that the
  requiring file is in
- can be thought of as `require_relative_to_the_requiring_file`
- tries to load "foo" relative to the requiring file's path not just the
  `$LOAD_PATH`
- It removes the need to manually prepend stuff to the `$LOAD_PATH`
- Like `require` it works on _features_ not _files_
- A relative path passed to `require` will **always be relative to the CWD of
  the process** but a relative path passed to `require_relative` will be
  relative to the file you are currently in.

Aside: dunder = double underscore

```ruby
File.expand_path("../../some_file", __FILE__)
# or
require_relative '../some_file'
```

TODO: rebuild require function in ruby code

### autoload

? a way of laoding constants as soon as they are referenced

```ruby
module Foo
  autoload :Bar, "xyz"
end

p Foo::Bar # xyz is loaded on this line, same rules as require
```

TODO: find out more about this, it seem rarely used

### RubyGems

Before rubygems if you wanted to add a new feature to your system you had to

1. modify `$LOAD_PATH` so that the file could be found
2. Install it into a dir which is already on the load path e.g. `vendor_ruby` or
   `site_ruby`

This was bad because:

- File conflicts
- Painful uninstall
- No way to have multiple versions of libraries

Enter Rubygems

- All gems live within a gems directory
- Each gem version has its own container directory within the gems directory
- each version of each gem has its own code, docs, tests etc.
- rubygems overrides the built-in require with one that knows how to find
  features in gems
- The correct terminology is to "require a _feature_ **within** a gem"

`Gem.path` is the path that ruby will use to find gems

```
[2] pry(main)> Gem.path
=> ["/Users/eoinkelly/.gem/ruby/2.2.0",
 "/Users/eoinkelly/.rbenv/versions/2.2.3/lib/ruby/gems/2.2.0"]
```

- The `$LOAD_PATH` is used to find _features_ - `Gem.path` finds gem container
  directories. `"#{Gem.path}/gem_name" is the gem directory
- Once the gem container directory is found, the gemspec in there is consulted
  and the `require_path` paths are added to the $LOAD_PATH

```ruby
# pseudocode for how gems are loaded

# read the spec for the required gem
spec = eval File.read("#{Gem.path}/specifications/#{some_gem_name}.gemspec")

# add all require_paths to $LOAD_PATH
spec.require_paths.each { |p| $LOAD_PATH << p }
```

```sh
# To inspect your gem environment on command line:
$ gem env
$ gem env path # same as `Gem.path` in irb
```

```ruby
p Gem::Specification.select(&:activated?).map { |gs| gs.full_name }
old_lp = $LOAD_PATH.dup
old_lf = $LOADED_FEATURES.dup

# When we require a feature while the gem aware require is loaded ...
#
require 'rake/file_list'

# ... that require will search through all of the gems it knows about looking
# for a file corresponding to the feature you have asked for.

# QUESTION: does it search in the existing load path before looking for the feature in gems?

# ... If there are multiple versions of a gem it gives preference to more
# recent versions ...

# ... When it finds the file corresponding to the feature ...

# ... it 'activates' the gem ...
puts 'Changes to activated gems:'
p Gem::Specification.select(&:activated?).map { |gs| gs.full_name }

# ... which adds its lib directory is added to $LOAD_PATH ...
puts 'Changes to $LOAD_PATH:'
p $LOAD_PATH - old_lp

# ... Then require proceeds as it usually would. If any `require` statements
# are found within the feature then they same process is followed for them.
puts 'Changes to $LOADED_FEATURES:'
lfs = $LOADED_FEATURES - old_lf
lfs.each { |lf| puts lf }
```

#### GEM_HOME and GEM_PATH

- GEM_PATH
    - the directories (there may be several) where gems can be found.
    - `gem env path`
- GEM_HOME
    - where gems will be installed (by default).
    - `gem env home`

Therefore GEM_PATH should include GEM_HOME

- Rubygems has built in environment which contains default values for these
- These are in rubygems env not the shell env by default i.e. use `gem env path`
  to see `GEM_PATH` not `env|grep GEM_PATH`

#### Why does "requiring a gem" seem to work?

- In reality `require` works with _features_.
- Gems can contain multiple _features_ (which can be implemented as either ruby
  code or compiled dynamic library)
- The _gem aware_ version of `require` that RubyGems provides
    1. Finds the gem that provides the feature
    2. Activates it which adds its `require_paths` to `$LOAD_PATH`
    3. Proceeds as the normal require would.

- There is a convention where you have a feature (implemented as a ruby file) in
  the `lib/` path of your gem. This is the feature that is loaded when you
  "require a gem". By convention this feature will load any other features that
  the gem needs.

Gems can have other features that you can load explicitly e.g.
`require "rake/file_list"` requires the `rake/file_list` feature which happens
to come from the `rake` gem.

You cannot "require a whole gem" but you can require a feature that loads all
the code in the gem.

#### The gem method

- `gem` is used as a workaround for require not understanding gems
- I think you would only need it on old versions of ruby whose `require` is not
  gem aware.

```ruby
# capture original load path
old_load_path = $LOAD_PATH.dup

gem 'bundler', '1.10.6'

# notice that the bundler gem /lib has been added to LOAD_PATH
p $LOAD_PATH - old_load_path
# => ["/Users/eoinkelly/.rbenv/versions/2.2.3/lib/ruby/gems/2.2.0/gems/bundler-1.10.6/lib"]

# require now works as usual
require 'bundler'
```

#### Reverting to ruby built-in require

- You can disable ruby gems with `ruby --disable=gems`. This will revert
  `require` back to the built-in ruby version.

#### Direct manipulation of $LOAD_PATH

You don't need to directly manipulate the `$LOAD_PATH` because `require` and
`require_relative` provide a lot of flexibility. It is still possible to do it
but is now an anti-pattern.

### auto loading

    TODO: implement a simple version of rails auto loading

### Command line tools

How do I check what command line tools are available in the current ruby?

```sh
$ ls -l `ruby -e "puts RbConfig::CONFIG['bindir']"`
```

- Note that ERB is built-in to ruby.
    - ERB can be used for files other than HTML!
- Note that `ruby -v` shows version _and_ enabled _verbose mode_. Use
  `ruby --version` to just see version string.
- `ruby -e` can span many lines (until it is terminated by another `"`)
    - in zsh at least you cannot edit a line after you have hit <RET>
    ```
    ➜  ruby -e "
    dquote> puts 'this is my program'
    dquote> puts Time.now
    dquote> "
    this is my program
    2014-08-15 07:31:08 +1200
    ```
- `ruby -rfeaturename`
    - you can require features at the command line
    - `ruby -rzlib my_zlib_needing_script.rb`
    - `ruby -rtime -e "puts Time.now.iso8601"`
    - not sure what use case of this with a scirpt would be?
    - this is handy for one liners as it is more concise than
      `require "some_feature"`

You can see that most of them are small wrappers (except for ruby itself)

# Chapter 2

- Objects in a program should not be constrained by the "real world"
- You can make an object to represent _anything_ - the world of objects is an
  imaginary one!

- Classes are _one_ way in ruby to bundle and label behaviours
- Each object can learn behaviours that its class did not teach it
- The concept of "classes" is built on top of "objects" - not the other way
  round.

ruby can return multiple values - they get automatically wrapped by an Array

```ruby
[1] pry(main)> def foo; return 33, "hello", 4.3; end
=> :foo
[2] pry(main)> foo
=> [33, "hello", 4.3]
```

Ruby methods _always_ return some value

```ruby
[3] pry(main)> def bar; end
=> :bar
[4] pry(main)> bar
=> nil
```

Objects are "born" with innate behaviours (from their class and modules) but can
"learn" new behaviours at any time in their life

## BasicObject

- has 7 methods
- does not implement #methods so cannot inspect them

Public instance methods

1. #!
2. #!=
3. #==
4. #**id** aka #object_id
5. #**send** aka #send
6. #equal?
7. #instance_eval
8. #instance_exec

Private instance methods

1. #method_missing
2. #singleton_method_added
3. #singleton_method_removed
4. #singleton_method_undefined

- ruby defines `__send__` and `__id__` so that you can add your own `#send` and
  `#id` methods to objects and still get at the built-in ruby methods
    - hand if e.g. your class sends emails

## `*` in ruby

### Sponge parameters

```ruby
# usage 1: as a "sponge parameter"
# capture 0+ method args into a single array
# any args captured by *rest are optional
def do_thing(a, b, *rest)
end

# capture all args into an unnamed array (capture and ignore)
def do_other(*)
end

# sponge parameters have the lowest priority when ruby is matching arguments to
# formal parameters so the following works
def do_other(head, second, *rest, last)
end

```

- sponge parameters have lower priority than default parameters so ruby will try
  to override defaults before giving any args to the sponge
- ruby will bind _every_ named parameter to a local variable - even if it is
  bound to an empty array or nil. "If it's named, it's local"

- only one sponge param is allowed in each method signature

Each ruby method argument has to be in _one_ of these categories:

1. required - `a`
2. default valued - `a=:foo`
3. optional - `*a`

There are 2 ways to create local variables in ruby

1. explicit assignment
2. binding of method arguments to method parameters

All variables in ruby are _references_ to object except for the following
_immediate values_:

1. integers
1. symbols
1. true
1. false
1. nil

```
[12] pry(main)> false.object_id
=> 0
[13] pry(main)> true.object_id
=> 20
[14] pry(main)> nil.object_id
=> 8
[15] pry(main)> 1.object_id
=> 3
[16] pry(main)> 2.object_id
=> 5
[17] pry(main)> :foo.object_id
=> 1651548
```

In the case of the immediate values the variable holds the value directly not a
reference to it. In practice you don't really notice because all the immedaite
values above are immutable.

The immediate values are all basically immutable global variables

> Ruby does not have pre and post increment operators because integers are
> stored as immediate values. `11` is just a value and it does not know how to
> deal with operators.

that explanation feels wrong to me - ruby can autowrap `11` in an object to
`11.times` so why not `11++`?

    TODO: dig deeper

There is only one `23` object in the system - all variables that contain `23`

```
x = 23
x++ #
x-- # syntax error
--x # noop
++x # noop

# ++ will add numbers
x ++ x # => 46
x + +x # => 46

23 -- 4 # => 27
is same as
23 - -4
23 ++ 4 # => 27
23 + +4
23 + 4  # => 27
23 - 4  # => 19
```

    lvalues = local, class, instance variables

    lvalues = things on the left side (or target) of an assignment

All (except for the few immutable exceptions) ruby variables are really
references to objects so if you pass them into a function they will mutate that
variable.

# clone and dup

- `#dup`
    - makes a "shallow" copy of an object - the ivars are copied but not the
      objects those ivars reference
    - modules that the object has been extended with will not be copied
    - copies tainted state
    - does not copy frozen state (DIFFERENCE)
    - does not copy the singleton class (DIFFERENCE)
    - dup typically uses the class to create a new instance
- `#clone`
    - makes a shallow copy of the object
    - copies tainted state
    - copies frozen state of an object (DIFFERENCE)
    - copies the singleton class (DIFFERENCE)
    - duplicates an object including its internal state

Classes can tweak how clone and dup work by implementing

- `#initialize_copy`
- `#initialize_clone`
- `#initialize_dup`

Important difference in ActiveRecord objects

- clone = create a new record with the same id so that when #save is called it
  will overwrite the existing record in the DB
- dup = create a new object with no id set so that #save will create a new
  record in the DB

- rails offers #deep_dup on Array, Hash, Object

- rails offers `#duplicable?` which tests whether the object can be duped
    - nil, false, true, symbol, number cannot be duped

# freeze

- freeze causes object to throw a `RuntimeError` if you try to mutate it
- mutates the object you call it on (it doesn't return a frozen version)
- if you freeze and array it does NOT freeze each object in the array

# frozen?

- tests whether the object is frozen or not

```ruby
thing = Object.new
aa = ["hello", 44, :foo]
aa.freeze
aa.frozen? # => true
```
