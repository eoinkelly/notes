- rails can serialise to CSV - meh. YAML is prob better
- Model.pluck
    - User.pluck(:name) # SELECT name FROM users
    - User.uniq.pluck(:name) # does SELECT DISTINCT name FROM users
- rails console
    - Model.group(:name, :email).count # gives you a nice summary of the
      groupings
    - User.instantiate( â€¦ ) # lets you specify id
- Postgres
    - joshsusser has a trick on his blog to disable the length restriction on
      :string types
    - he shows how to do full text search
    - GIN = generic inverted index
- rails can fairly easily put each user in their own database by reloading a
  custom DB when loading e.g based on username
- rails has a deep merge for hashes - see #deep_merge (rails uses this for
  params)
- #except
    - my_hash.except(:name, :foo) # returns a hash with the named keys removed
- #reverse_merge
    - merges in unless it is already in there (diff to #merge)
- #inquiry
    - env = Rails.env
    - env.development? # true|false
    - "foo".inquiry.foo? # => true
    - JEG2 shows how to set up your models so they can respond to this too
- ERB has comments <%# i do not become a HTML comment %>
- you can use #tap on a variable in the view to delimit its scope in the view -

    - rails can route exceptions to any rack app (including itself)
        - so you can route to itself and handle 404s yourself
        - you can mount any sinatra (or rack) app into your rails app
- CSV - he showed a snippet for sending CSV to browser - handy for navigator
  future
- rails can write files to the filesystem atomically (by writing to a tmp and
  then moving)
