# Writing thread safe code in Ruby

## The GIL

> MRI 1.9 prevents the Ruby code itself from running in parallel by requiring
> that any thread running Ruby code hold a lock. This lock is commonly knows as
> the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) or GVL (Global VM Lock).

> the GIL is released if a Thread is waiting on an external event (normally IO)
> which improves responsiveness. MRI 1.9 also includes an experimental API that
> C extensions can use to run some C code without the GIL locked to utilize
> parallelism. This API is very restrictive though because no Ruby object may be
> accessed in any way while the GIL is not held by the current thread.

## Ruby implementations

- MRI
    - Threads in MRI ruby can improve delays caused by IO waits.
    - They cannot help you utilise more cores
    - uses native threads to implement `Thread`
- JRuby
    - Thread can be used to solve problems where you want to use more than one
      core
    - layers the Thread class on top of Javaâ€™s thread class so it uses whatever
      the JVM does
        - The JVM maps java threads to an OS thread

## Ruby tools

The following classes are helpful for writing thread safe code in Ruby

- `Thread`
- `Queue`
- `Mutex`

## Multi-threading in Rails

QUESTION: does spawning threads from a rails app a problem good/bad depending on
which rack server you use e.g. unicorn vs puma?
