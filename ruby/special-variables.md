# Ruby special variables

- Ruby special variables are _usually_ not global despite their `$` prefix
- They are often thread local or even method local

```ruby
global_variables # => returns array of symbols of the names of global variables
```

ruby -p -a -e 'someprogram'

- `$LOADED_FEATURES`
    - scope ???

- `$LOAD_PATH`
    - scope ???
    - mutable

Process related

- `$0` or `$PROGRAM_NAME`
    - scope: ???
    - mutable
    - name of the current program
    - memonic for `argv[0]` in C
    - ru
- `$*` or ``
    - mutable
    - scope: ???
    - program args
    - conceptually `argv[1..]` in a C program
    - it does not include program name like C does
- `$$` or `$PROCESS_ID` or `$PID`
    - scope: ???
    - instance of `Integer`
    - the current process ID
- `$?` or `$CHILD_STATUS`
    - scope: ???
    - exit code of the most recent subprocess
    - instance of `Process::Status` not `Integer` (unlike `$PROCESS_ID`)

IO related

- `$_` or ``
    - `gets` and `readline` implicitly store the last line the read in this
      variable
    - `print` called without arg will output the value of this variable
    - designed for use in one-line scripts on command line
- `$<` or `ARGF`
- `$>` or `$stdout`
- `$;` or `$RS` or `$INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR`
    - input record separator
    - designed for one-liner usage
- `$\` or `$ORS` or `$OUTPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR`
    - output record separator
    - designed for one-liner usage

- `or`

Exception related

- `$@` or `$ERROR_POSITION`
    - scope: ???
    - returns Array of backtrace or current exception
    - equivalient to `$!.backtrace`
- `$!` or `$ERROR_INFO`
    - scope: ???
    - the currently active exception

Regexp related

- These variables are aliases for class level methods - both the variable
  **and** the class method are thread local. Class methods you write are not
  thread local.
- The `English` gem provides no aliases for these variables

```ruby
str = "2017: ERROR: some message"
re = /ERROR|WARN/
```

- `$~` or `Regexp.last_match`
    - scope: thread local

- `$&` or ``
    - scope: thread local
    - shows the full previous match

- `$`or`
    - scope: thread local
    - the part of the string before the match
- `$'` or ``
    - scope: thread local
    - the part of the string after the match

- `$1`, `$2` etc.
    - the value of that capture group within the previous match
