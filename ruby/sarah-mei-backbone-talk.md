# Sarah Mei: Backbone & Rails talk

- bb has no controllers
- what bb means by models, templates, views, controllers is different to what
  rails means

Backbone rails

---

models/collections --> models templates --> views views --> controllers

- A backbone view is a piece of code that controls a piece of the DOM

SM reckons JS usage in ralis goes from:

1. using the automagic rails js stuff
2. client wants stuff that this doesn't do well, so they move to raw jquery
3. that becomes a mess when there is a lot of it, so they move to a "page
   object" pattern
4. when you outgrow that you think about client side rendering (moustache &
   friends).

SM recommends not using rails js helpers in anything except very simple apps

## page objects pattern

- take all the JS separate it into unit testable functions and put is in a JS
  object scoped to the page being rendered
- this means you can unit test all the functions and the integration test can
  just check that your initialize() is being called
- pro: you can test it easier
- cons: you do a lot of boilerplate

rails dev want (and backbone provides)

- client side rendering
- model mirroring

SM sees 2 patterns in use:

pattern 1: greenfield _ use rails just as api server _ no server side rendering
into HTML * a *lot* of work compared to old way * used a lot when people
building mobile apps as well as site \* she would consider something more
opinianted than backbone for future green-field apps (backbone is maybe too
flexible for this)

pattern 2: application in transition _ an existing rails app that is rendering
HTML server-side _ backbone as frosting on the cake _ stuff still rendered on
the server, then backbone overlays it and takes over _ she thinks that backbones
sweet-spot is this "frosting" pattern as backbone is very flexible
