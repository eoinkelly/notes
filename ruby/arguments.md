# Passing arguments in ruby

* can be used for both destructuring or constructing (depends on the context
* in method signature it is used as for **constructing** (constructs a collection from multiple separate arguments)
* in method call site it is used for **destructuring** (takes a collection and breaks it apart into separate arguments)
* Ruby 3.0+ changes how keyword args are splatted
