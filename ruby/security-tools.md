Gemnasium

- https://github.com/gemnasium/toolbelt
- upload Gemfile, Gemfile.lock then they parse and show you html report
- paid service, has nice reporting and alerts etc.
    - will send emails to team etc
- presumably does real-time alerting (things like bundle-audit only check when
  we actually check in code
- not just ruby

Bundle-audit

- ++ free
- -- vulns DB needs to be updated by their devs so there can be a lag

Gemcanary

- in beta, seems similar to Gemnasium
