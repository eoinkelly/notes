> Factor belongs to the family of concatenative languages: this means that, at
> the lowest level, a Factor program is a series of words (functions) that
> manipulate a stack of references to dynamically-typed values.

- Functions are called _words_.
- Things on the stack are dynamically typed.
- Has a garbage collector
- Compiled to native code (but also has REPL)
- Whitespace is used to separate words (factor doesn't care what kind of
  whitespace you use .e.g.
- Uses postfix notation (so called reverse polish notation) so has not operator
  precedence The stack is used to organise calls to words, not as a data
  structure

- Includes a GUI toolkit based on OpenGL
- Has a HTTP server, web framework and DB adapters
- Uses an image a bit like smalltalk - compiled code and data are stored into
- the image and then the image is saved
    - Has a special tool for building a minimal image when deploying a
    - stand-alone application
- Is typed
- Has an FFI for interfacing with C etc.

> Expressing yourself with pure composition and without locals or named

```factor
[ * ]
```

is considered the same as

```
[
*
]
```

## Listener UI

```
Ctrl+p = prev line of history
Ctrl+n = next line of history
Tab = show tab completions
```

## words

Some commonly used words

```
clear   = clear the stack
.       = pretty print the thing at the top of the stack
length  = replace any "sequence" at top of stack with its length
```

- comments begin with `! ` (the space is important)

### Stack effect

- An annotation for functions
- A description of what the word (function) does to the stack

```
( things-off -- things-on )
(x y -- z) = 2 things off, puts one thing on
the things can be named anything to help document the word
```

### Vocabularies

- Words are organised into _Vocabularies_ (as functions are organised into
  modules in other langs)

From that google tech talk:

`[a,b]` is a word that takes two numbers off the top of the stack and creates a
range out of them.

```factor
: factorial ( n -- n! )
  1 [a,b] product ;

factorial 100
```

- code is data in factor - you can quote words to prevent them from being
  executed and instead pass them around like data
- words that take other words as arguments are called _combinators_
- There are no control flow keywords in factor - all control flow is done using
- _combinators_
