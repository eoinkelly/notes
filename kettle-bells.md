# Simple & sinister

Two movements

1. The "hard style" kettlebell swing
    - uses a sharp exhalation performed with maximla tension and ideally, for
      greater concentration, a scream, followed by a short breath hold (used
      during strking)
2. The get-up
    - uses steady, even breathing punctuated by forced diaphramtic exhalations
      during exertions (similar to wrestling, grappling, footwork, some blocks)

Training 3 to 6 times per week focus is always on perfect technique no rushing
between sets - how long? keep moving between sets (walking, shadow boxing,
moving arms) untilyour heart-rate is halfway down to normal workout is 100
swings total sets of 10 get-ups 5 get-ups per arm sets of 1

workouts aim to leave something in the tank for emergencies - a workout should
give you more than it takes from you

Every two weeks do a non-stop all-out set of swings

begin by using 16kg and 24kg bells eventually move on to 24kg and 32kg bells
they recommend training barefoot for bettr balance, stability & coordination

don't put spink tinto flexion (forward bending) during or after training -
forward bending could cause back enjury

- focus on quality not quantity
