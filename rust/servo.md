# Servo

## Power consumption

- doing work in parallel is better for power consumption!
- it turns out that doing stuff on all cores for less time takes less power than
  running one core for longer
- layout is necessary for the user to see _anything_ on the page so it should be
  prioritzed.

## "Concurrency" vs "fine grained parallellism"

- sometimes there is one task we want to complete as quickly as possible
- concurrency is doing multiple tasks at the same time
- paralellism is doing a single task faster
- because layout is so important we want to parallelise it and put all our CPU
  power towards it

Aside:

    currently iframes run on the main thread - in servo it will be possible for
    them to not be

Aside:

    during layout widths are computed top down, heights are computed bottom up
