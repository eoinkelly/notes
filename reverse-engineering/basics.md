## Disassemblers

- GUI for mac
    - IDA - seems to be the Photoshop of disassemblers with a photoshop like
      price to go with it.
    - Hopper
        - seems good
        - cheaper than IDA (and works on mac)
        - free demo quite crippled
- Command line on Mac
    - `nm <binary>` - displays symbol table
    - `otool -t <binary>` show contents of `__TEXT` section as hex
    - `otool -vt <binary>` show contents of `__TEXT` and disassemble it (ATT
      syntax)
    - `otool -Vt <binary>` show contents of `__TEXT` and symbolically
      disassemble it (ATT syntax)
    - `/usr/local/bin/ndisasm -p intel -b 64 -a <binary>`
        - dumps much more than just the TEXT section
- Command line on Linux
    - ???
- Windows only
