# Container

The router and templates are fairly unique in ember (as opposed to models,
views, controllers etc.)

- ember has exactly one router
- it has access to a store
- it is always an instance
- it maps routes to states <— NB
- it is available on **all** route objects as the `router` property e.g
  this.get(‘router.url’) in any Route object will get the url form the global
  singleton router

What properties are in the router object that are useful:

- methods
    - url = returns the current url
- properties
    - location = the type of URLs that the app will use: hash|history|none

templates are just functions - they are not objects - you cannot instantiate
them - they take a context object and return a string representation of it

What makes things similar? shared interface e.g. all views share the same
interface (expose the same set of stuff) this is often extracted into a shared
superclass shared dependencies all route objects have access to the router
singleton. views do not. => routes have a shared dependency that views do not
shared usage

Thing | Instantiated | New each time? | Type | —————————————————————————————
Component | Y | Yes | Class | Controller | Yes | No | Class | Template | No | No
| Function |

Shared discovery how do you find the thing when you need it e.g. Tempalates =
Ember[‘TEMPLATES’] Models = App.Foo Controller = App.FooController

## Containers in general

containers contain a registry keyed on ‘type:name’ string that can hold
constructors. when you lookup a constructor, the registry gives you back an
instance of the object. the first time you call it it will create the instance,
every time after that it just returns the same instance containers allow objects
inside them to ask them to find other objects for them it functions as a DI
system contaiers can be configured from outside to resolve property requests
from objects inside in a certain way e.g. a logger you can tell containers not
to instantiate the object when it finds it e.g. if you store a function or
primitive value in there you can tell the container that a particular key should
not be memoized containers have a resolve function that decides how the param
you pass in to lookup should be converted into the acutal key name e.g.
‘IndexController’ -> ‘controller:index’

The resolver is plugged into the container and it does all the finding of things
based on their key names

## The Ember Application Container

Ember apps have exactly one container => ember objcts have a `container`
property that will give you a reference to it: this.container (note you don’t
use get()) the keys are colon separated e.g. router:main

App.register(‘customnamespace:thing’, App.SomeObject) // manually add stuff to
the container App.inject(‘controller’, ‘analytics’, ‘customnamespace:thing’) //
control what object will be found when objects in the container do a lookup

You typically run the above methos as part of initializers needs in controller
is a form of DI needs ‘foo’, // ember does a lookup in the controllers section
of the application container

Ember makes App.**container** available but don’t use it!
