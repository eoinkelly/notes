# Is it good/bad for ember models to not match the server models?

# Manage form validation by having a no. of "states" taht the form goes through e.g.

- initail
- editing
- loading
- failure
- success

Usage

- keep these states as an attribute of the component that manages the form
- have action handlers set the state depnding on what happened in the DOM
- you can apply these states as classes on the component element and use them to
  scope your CSS

# Investigate didAppear hook of views

> Need to handle view transitions, in the visual sense? Define a mixin that
> implements two methods: didInsertElement (be sure to call this.\_super()!),
> which in turn calls didAppear. Each viewâ€™s didAppear hook can then set up any
> transitional properties necessary to animate the view appearing.

# Investigate why didTransition isn't called on route change sometimes ???

# Idea: ember-vuvuzela

- a lib you load that overrides the normal ember objects and outputs console log
  whenever their hooks are invoked
- the idea being that you can turn this on as a newb and see what is happening
  in your app.
