# Ember testing


# helpers

What is the benefit of creating an ember helper over just creating a global function?

* You could register ember helpers even when app is in production and they won't be avaialbe until you call `Ember.injectTestHelpers()` - not sure how this helps tho

# how to mock model data


From the discuss thread

> I would recommend avoiding calling App.reset() between tests and just
> creating a new app instance and tearing it down with
> App.create()/App.destroy().

the above was from a guy who had a non-standard api to test

## create() vs. pulling it out of container

container generally gives you back a singleton which means state could leak across tests
it is an anti-parttern to pull the object under test out of the container for unit tests


* registering new ember test helpers seem to be built on the existing helpers
* they are injected into the global by `App.injectTestHelpers()` (just like the existing helpers)
* Q: waht is the benefit of usins them vs just making some global functions yourself?

# notes from reading ember-testing source

in general the helpers use `findByAssert()` so they also check that the thing you are looking for exists
=> they are superior to doing it manually

`findByAssert()` throws `EmberError` - research how this is diff from ordinary `Error`

`click()`
    * does a `findByAssert` so as well as clicking it will fail if the element is not there
    * is a bit fancier than just running a jquery click - if the element is an input it triggers 'focusin'
    * it triggers the following events:
        * mousedown (optionally `focus`, `focusin` if certain element types),  mouseup, click

`wait()`
* Ember.Test keeps internal track of asynch work that has been started but not finished e.g.
    * AJAX
    * run loop runs
    * timers in run loop
    * route transitions in progress
* all of the helpers that return promises go through `wait()`
* it is the thing that calls `asyncStart` and asyncEnd` in the adapter
* is available for use in tests
    * ??? when would you use it
* returns a promise that will resolve when all of these are true:
    * the rotuer has fully finished any transistion it is in
    * all the waiting ajax requests have returned
    * the run loop is finished (and any timers scheduled in it)
* basically `wait()` returns a promise that will be resolved when all the outstanding work has been done - Ember.Test keeps trakc of the async work and `wait()` polls every 10 mS to see if it has completed

`andThen()` just sticks the callback you provide as a then on the promise `wait()` returns

### The magic of lastPromise

* `Ember.Test` provides a constructor for making promises
    * it passes everything throught to `RSVP` but it also saves the newly created promise into `Test.lastPromise`
    * this allows it to automatically chain promises that you create wiht the ember async helpers
## ember-qunit

* based on rspec
* allows you to write unit specs in isolation

* provieds `window.emq` global
  globalize() // inject normal ember test helpers onto window

Global methods

```javascript

// Globals
emq.globalize()
var res = Ember.DefaultResolver.extend({ namespace: 'App' });
setResolver(res.create())

// E66 Modules
emq.globalize()
import Resolver from '/path/to/resolver';
import { setResolver } from 'ember-qunit';
setResolver(Resolver.create());
```

moduleFor('router:main', 'optional description', callbacks); // arg is a lookup string for container
moduleForComponent()
moduleForModel()

moduleFor
* replaces `module` in your qunit test
* args
    * name of factory to lookup
    * a nice description to see in your test output
    * an object containing the normal qunit setup, teardown callbacks
        * which can also contain a `needs` attribute which loads other controllers
* maintains its own isolate container
* uses the arg to lookup the factory from the main container
* copies from main container into isolated one
* aliases the `create()` of the factory we just copied over as `subject()`
    * `this.subject()` is like `App.__container__.lookup('thing:subthing').create()`
* at the end of the test it dumps its container

moduleForComponent()
* args
    * short name of comonents that you would use in handlebars e.g. `foo-thing`
    * other args same as `moduleFor`

this.$() will render the component the first time it is called as will this.append (???)


moduleForModel()


ember-qunit is part of ember-cli

```javascript
moduleFor('controller:stuff', 'The suff controller', { needs: ['application']});

test('name', function () {
  var stuffCtrl = this.subject(); // App.__container__.lookup('controller:stuff')
  var appCtrl = stuffCtrl.get('controllers.application');

  })
