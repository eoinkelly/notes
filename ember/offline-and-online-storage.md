I want a solution for a good offline experience for my app

# tools

- orbit.js
    - ember-orbit
    - ++ does provide multiple data stores
- indexed-db https://github.com/kurko/ember-indexeddb-adapter
    - -- doesn't provide online + offline feature
- pouch-db offers something called pouch-db server ???
- localforage
    - from mozilla
        > Offline storage, improved. Wraps IndexedDB, WebSQL, or localStorage
        > using a simple but powerful API.
    - https://github.com/genkgo/ember-localforage-adapter
    - -- doesn't provide online + offline feature
- firebase
    - no offline support OOTB
    - ++ easy to setup

# optoins

use the offline store as my primary store and only occasionaly sync with server
(when it can) this would allow localforage to work
