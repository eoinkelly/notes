How to handle fixture data

Options

1. Maintain a single set of test fixtures
    - switch adapter based on environment
    - -- all tests depend on these fixtures so they are very hard to change
1. Maintain multiple sets of test fixtures
    - -- probably a lot of duplication between each set
1. Stub out HTTP calls so that the app thinks it is talking to a server

    - ++ you only make as much "fixture" as you need for each test and that
      fixture data is right there above the test
