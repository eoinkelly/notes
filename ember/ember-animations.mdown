# Ember Animations

- [slides](http://ef4.github.io/ember-animation-demo/)
- Animating within a route is the simple case
  - it is pretty easy to make these be components

- animations between routes is possible but harder
  - it touches every aspect of the stack
  - he has a pretty good transition
  - we want to stall the transition long enough to fade/slide/animate away
  - we don't want to do that all the time tho e.g. if the user types a different
    URL in the bar
  - the willTransition hook is really handy when you want to make things leave
    the page in a pretty way
- he implemented modal with query params - had a showModal=true param that was
  there when
- lets you make a really nice modal that can be cancled by back button or
  entered directly via URL
- he put a named outlet in the application template that is rendered into

he disables ember built-in event handlers and explicitly enables them via
components because he thinks it make it faster
