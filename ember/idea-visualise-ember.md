# the dream

I want ember to have better app visualisation than any tech I have worked on
before

think `rails erd` as an app that you can manipulate

features taht would be cool visualise the routes as a state diagram clicking on
a route reveals the component underneath

execution flows it would be cool to see the path that execution takes through
each object e.g. when you move from one route to another you could visualise
what order the hooks get hit in

This could be done with D3 as an ember-inspector plugin

# an MVP

what is the minimum taht would be useful?

docs on how ember moves from one route to another

the app would need to be able to display visuals of how the ember app is
structured - these could be done statically before being clickable etc. could
trial them in a blog post or a handbook
