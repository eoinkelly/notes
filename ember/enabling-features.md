## How to enable a new feature:

```javascript
// this should be loaded before you load Ember
EmberEnv = {
  FEATURES = {
    'query-params-new': true
  }
}
```

- `EmberENV` is set first

- Features are available in canary builds
- Features are also in beta and release ??? but don't do this because none of
  the bugfixes for them will go into beta

- feature flag is an if block used by the Ember build process
- they use feature flags to try new stuff without having semver go nuts

### features.json

- You can tell what features are enabled look at `features.json` in the ember
  repo.
- Within `features.json`:
    - true = feature is enabled and the surrounding if statemetns have been
      removed
    - false = feature is disabled and the if statements + their contents are
      removed (feature totally gone)
        - you cannot enable this at runtime
    - null = feature is disabled but the code for it is still there
        - you can enable it at runtime

Canary: all features have 'null' value so can be enabled Beta & Release: all
features ???

Questions:

can i turn on features in release ???
