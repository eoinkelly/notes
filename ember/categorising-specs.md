Q: What makes a spec be "integration" vs "unit"?

From ember docs:

> unit tests do not require the application to be running

factors

- depends on the whole, working App being available
- depends on getting stuff out of the Ember container
- depends on ember test helpers (which are injected into the global scope)
- depends on a DOM being available

access patterns access the test subject via it's JS interface access the test
subject via the real, whole, application DOM access it via a fixture DOM
