Alternatives:

    - diff: has no state machine backing each model
    - supports REST backends, streaming still TODO
    - last touched july 2014
- Plain old $.ajax
    - Discourse uses it.
    - QUESTION: Where is its sweet spot?
    - QUESTION: how to use it in such a way that you can grow into ember-data or
      others?
- Ember-model https://github.com/ebryn/ember-model
    - Intentional limited feature set - provides primitves on $.ajax

# Features to compare on

What are the things that we should compare persistence frameworks against each
other:

- A model API for the rest of the app to use.
    - ideally this should wrap all persistence related stuff so the persistence
      layer could be changed easily
    - QUESTION: how easily is it to match the semantics of the different
      peristence options?
- side loading
- relationships
    - embedded or "reference by id"
        - is having both a bad thing?
- how does it handle asynchrony
    - probably making everything return a promise all the time is a good idea
- performance
    - speed
    - memory usage
- REST and/or real-time
    - Is hiding this as an implementation detail form the rest of the app a good
      idea?

### The Store

- there is exactly one instance of `DS.Store` in the app
- models do **not** have data themselves - they just define the structure
    - is it bad/even possible to add default values to models ??
- you refer to it:
    - it is available as `this.store` in route objects
- memoizes records
    - the second time you load a record, the store will give you the cached
      version
    - you will get back the _exact same instance_ that you got the last time
    - this feature is known as "identity map"
    - it means that any changes you make in one part of the app will be
      propagated to others - this is much easier than managing multiple
      instances of a record in memory at the same time
- `find()` always returns a promise immediately

### Records (instances of models)

- are instances of models
- identified by

1. a **globally unique** id and
    - can be generated client side. ???
2. model name

### The Adapter

- system has a single apdater
- it is a translator
- translates calls from the model layer into the appropraite storage/server
  calls
- the system will ask the adapter for models that it doesn't have cached already

### The Serializer

- converts between JSON and record objects (instances of models)
- could also convert between binary data if you needed it to

### Model naming

photo App.Photo userProfile App.UserProfile

### Attributes

attributes `DS.attr()` control how the JSON string representation is turned into
a real JS object (and vice versa)

- passing a type to `DS.attr()` controls what kind of property will be corerced
  into
- default attrs: string, number, boolean, date

# relationships

hasMany relationship expects an array of ids in the JSON belongsTo expects a
single id

You You can add computed properties to models that depend on primitive
properties

You can sideload more records in the same JSON response

### RestAdapter

```
namespace: '/api/v1',
host: 'http://www.foo.com'

var post = store.find('post', 1); // GET /posts/1

// for odd pluralization
Ember.Inflector.inflector.irregular('formula', 'formulae'); // GET /formulae/1 not GET /formulas/1
Ember.Inflector.uncountable('advice'); // ???
```

Expects JSON:

- camelCased attribute names
- the primary record being returned should be in a named root e.g.
  `GET /people/12` should return
    ```
    { person: {
        name: 'Eoin'
      }
    }
    ```
- irregular keys can be mapped with a custom serializer

# How do you tell the store to empty records from its cache?

store.unloadAll('post'); unload all records of type 'post' from the store

store.unloadRecord(record);

record.transitionTo('deleted.saved');

# Problems with it

as of july 2013 transactions are not promises can't do complex transactions
between relationships data is "locked" while it is being saved - if you try to
touch a model while it is in-flight it will throw an error this prevents you
from "optimistically assuming that the operation will succeed this makes it hard
for write heavy apps limited error handling lots of corner cases

# why do they have client-id as well as the id from the server

If you send a parent and X children to be saved to the server and you get back
the parent and X children you don't know whether it is the same X children -
they server might have rejected one child but had a new one from another source
to send you. THis is why they use unique client-id as well as the id from the
server

# Ember data models internal state machine

Models have at least 3 states

clean -> dirty -> inFlight

inFlight is when the model is beign saved to the server
