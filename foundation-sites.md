# Foundation 6

Has two main sections

1. sites - stuff for responsive websites
2. emails - stuff for responsive emails

There is a separate CLI tool called foundation-cli

- https://github.com/zurb/foundation-cli
- downloads & installs blank templates for you
- can also run a build watcher

THe sass version:

- when installed from npm, also installs
    - jquery
    - what-input

### what-input

- changes the value of `data-whatinput` on `<html>` input to indicate what kind
  of input is was last in use e.g. mouse, keyboard, touch
- changes teh value of `data-whatintent` to tell you when touch is being used as
  a mouse etc.
- it does it by attaching an event listener to `<html>` and listening for the
  many kinds of events e.g mouseup, mousedown etc.

- doesn't count typing in form `<input>` or `<textarea>` as a new kind of input

```
when the page first loads

<html lang="en" data-whatinput="initial" data-whatintent="initial" class=" whatinput-types-initial">

after moving around

<html lang="en" data-whatinput="initial" data-whatintent="mouse" class=" whatinput-types-initial">

and then clicking

<html lang="en" data-whatinput="mouse" data-whatintent="mouse" class=" whatinput-types-initial whatinput-types-mouse">

and then hitting tab on keyboard

<html lang="en" data-whatinput="keyboard" data-whatintent="mouse" class=" whatinput-types-initial whatinput-types-mouse whatinput-types-keyboard">
```

Using the SCSS version

- settings file must be imported _before_ the main foundation file
    - there is no automatic update of settings file between foundation releases
    - you have to many copy the starter settings file from foundation and import
      it into your project (the ember generator does this in the case of
      ember-cli-foundation-6-sass addon)
- foundation is split into "components"
    - each component has a core set of SCSS variables which modify its styling

There are two main ways to use foundation

```
// import everything
@import 'settings';
@import 'foundation';
@include foundation-everything
```

vs

```
// import each component separately
@import 'settings';
@import 'foundation';
