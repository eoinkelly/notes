## Plug wiring in NZ

- Since 2006 the live and neutral pins must be insulated on new appliances.
- If the device has a 3 prong plug, then the earth pin is connected to the case
  in some way.
- double insulated appliance is encased in 2 layers of insulation has a "square
  within a square" symbol

## Class I (earthed) vs Class II (double insulated) devices

Requirements for appliances used in New Zealand

In New Zealand all electrical appliances must include a nameplate identifying
its voltage (V), and either its current (I) or wattage (W), and indicate whether
the appliance is double insulated. If the appliance is double insulated it will
show the symbol, a square box within a square box, see Figure 1 (Page 7). The
nameplate may also contain other information relevant to the appliance.

Typical information that could be found on a Nameplate:

Volts or voltage (V) = 230 V
Current (I) = 4.4 A
Wattage (W) = 1000 W
Double insulation = square box within a square box

There are two types of electrical appliance in New Zealand:

1. Earthed electrical appliances (These types of electrical appliances are called Class I appliances).

These types of electrical appliances have a connection to earth,
which means that any exposed metal of the appliance is connected to
earth (e.g. toaster, electric iron etc). They have a power supply cord
with 3-wires, brown, blue and green/yellow, and are fitted with a 3-pin
plug.

2. Double insulated electrical appliances (These types of electrical appliances are called Class II appliances).

These types of electrical appliances will NOT have any connection
to earth. This means that the exposed metal (e.g. electric drill) has a
physical barrier between any metal and the electrical components.
They have a power supply cord with 2-wires, brown and blue, and are
fitted with a 2-pin plug.

If a 3-wire flexible cord is used on a double insulated electrical
appliance, the green/yellow wire MUST be connected at the plug but
must NOT be connected to any part of the double insulated
appliance. The green/yellow wire must be cut back to the outer
insulation of the flexible cord

### Class II devices

An appliance with double insulation, also known as a Class II electrical
appliance is one which has been built in such a way that it does not require a
connection to electrical earth (ground), and has 2 layers of insulation to
protect the user.

The basic requirement is that no single failure can result in dangerous voltage
becoming exposed so that it might cause an electric shock and that this is
achieved without relying on an earthed metal casing. This is usually achieved at
least in part by having two layers of insulating material surrounding live parts
or by using reinforced insulation.

In the United Kingdom, a double insulated appliance must be labelled Class II,
double insulated, or bear the double insulation symbol (a square inside another
square).

An example of a double insulated electrical appliance could be an electric drill
or a desk fan. Other items that are class 2 could be a lamp or a hand blender.

It does not make grounding not necessary, it just reduces the risk such that no
single point of failure will zap you. Regulators have decided that's "good
enough" to reasonably protect you from electrical shock.

Basically, you want several things to have to go wrong for you to die, not just
one, and that's the point of double insulation.
